    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mountain, pine tree, cañon, gulch,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cookies, bacon!—like ’em much.</div>
      <div class='line'>Canteen, hike-stick!</div>
      <div class='line'>Hi-hi-hike-stick!</div>

      <div class='line'>Flathead!—Ra-a-a!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Thirty lusty juvenile throats, strong with frequent
exercise, caused Mummy Cañon to ring with
this school-yell. It was almost evening, and the
boys of Lakefarm School were on their return
from a day’s outing in the mountains. Clad in
Boy Scout uniforms and wearing Rough Rider
hats, they presented a picturesque appearance in
that wild, rocky, mountain country, while their
school-yell echoed among the hills, bright in the
setting sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was midsummer, yet thirty of the forty-four
regular students were in attendance during the
summer term, evidence of the popularity of the
school, for they were all boys of the age that welcomes
vacation time with cheers.</p>

<p class='c009'>In spring this cañon was a beautiful place; in
summer it lost some of its freshness, but was still
beautiful; in fall it lost more of life, but beauty
still clung to it; in winter, it was a picture that
called for deep admiration. It also might well
have been named Echo Cañon; indeed many in
that part of Colorado often called it that. But
Mummy Cañon it had been christened, and this
was the only name by which it was known on the
maps and in the guide books.</p>

<p class='c009'>Interesting stories were told about this great
mountain gorge. They had to do with the ancient
inhabitants of the country, the cliff-dwellers, ruins
of whose homes were to be found here and there
high up in steep places. The boys of Lakefarm
knew these stories by heart. They had been told
over and over and added to until enough new and
interesting details had been gathered around the
original stories to fill a book.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Regulus Byrd, head master, Chief Scout,
and owner of Lakefarm, was as peculiar as his
name. Some called him eccentric, but the boys of
the school and the friends of the doctor did not
agree. The boys loved him as few schoolmasters
ever are loved; the older people of the district
declared that when it came to a pinch, Dr. Byrd
never lacked judgment.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor and the two instructors of the school,
Mr. Frankland and Mr. Porter, were with the
boys on the outing from which they were now returning.
Mr. Frankland was a short, brisk, wide-awake
man, who smiled frequently and shrewdly.
Mr. Porter was an odd personage, dignified and
very positive in all things, but an excellent instructor
in manual training. After the procession
had advanced well toward the heart of the gully
and given two or three school-yells that raised the
echoes, Mr. Porter said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dr. Byrd, we’re only three miles from home.
Why not stop here, build a fire, and sit around
and talk a while?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the stuff,” came from several of the
boys at the same time. Dr. Byrd had a boy’s
heart, and as there was no good reason for opposing
the suggestion, he gave his consent.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a jiffy the boys scattered in all directions in
search of firewood; up the side of the hill and
along the near bank of a noisy mountain stream,
and soon were returning with armfuls of dead
wood. Most of them were experienced in building
camp fires in true frontier style, and the work
progressed rapidly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two of the boys, Hal Kenyon and Byron Bowler,
were delegated to the work of starting the
fire. This was not done by striking a match and
touching it to some dry leaves. The method employed
was one more suited to the romantic scene.
First, Hal and Byron searched until they found
two serviceable pieces of dry cottonwood root.
Having good, strong, sharp pocketknives, they
proceeded to whittle and shave the roots. One
was made flat and about three-fourths of an inch
thick; the other was cut slim and round and
sharpened at both ends. In one edge of the flat
piece was cut a notch, and close to the notch was
sunk a hole to fit one end of the slim piece. Then
a small hand-piece with a socket for the other end
of the drill was prepared by Byron, while Hal cut
a section of a small green limb, two feet long,
which with a thong made a bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the material needed for starting a fire was
now ready save a supply of tinder. This was
obtained by rubbing a piece of dry cedar on a
rough boulder, producing a handful of easily
lighted shreds. The notched piece of wood was
now placed on a flat rock, the drill was inserted
in place and the string of the bow looped tightly
over it. Then the top-socket-piece was set on the
other end for a handle, and the bow was drawn
back and forth, the notched piece being held in
place under the foot of the operator.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal Kenyon operated the device. The drill
revolved rapidly in the socket, and presently a
fine brown powder was flowing into the notch. In
a few seconds this powder was smoking densely
and slight fanning with a hat brought a flame.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some of the tinder was now applied and after
a little blowing, a tiny flame leaped up. The rest
of the tinder was then applied, followed by some
cedar bark and small wood. Pretty soon the fire
was roaring and crackling, while the boys piled
on more fuel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now for our camp-fire yell,” cried Hal when
the last armful of fuel had been deposited on the
burning heap. Immediately the cañon rang and
echoed with thirty young voices chanting the following:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Camp-fire, rah!</div>
      <div class='line'>Smoke-punk, ha!</div>
      <div class='line'>Tinder, Lakefarm!</div>
      <div class='line'>Rah—rah—rah!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This yell was repeated several times until it
seemed as if the rocks poised aloft would be
shaken loose and come crashing down on the reckless
Boy Scouts. Then the boys scattered again,
each returning presently with another load of
fuel, which was deposited near the blazing pile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well done, my lads, well done,” announced
Dr. Byrd as the last load was dropped. “Now
what are we going to do next?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eat supper,” replied Allie Atkins, with a
slap of his hand on his hungry region.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course; I almost forgot that,” laughed
the doctor. “I’m always forgetting my stomach.
That’s the reason I haven’t dyspepsia. Always
forget your stomachs, boys, until they remind
you of their existence and you’ll be all right in
that spot. But what are we going to eat? Nothing
left, is there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How about the fish?” inquired Walter Hurst,
commonly known as “Pickles” because of his
fondness for that table delicacy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s right. This is just the time and place
to cook them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suggestion was followed accordingly. The
fish—two score of mountain trout—had been
caught by the boys in the Rio Grande several
miles to the east early in the morning. As they
had enough other food for breakfast and dinner,
their catch had been saved for the next morning’s
meal at the school.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course the doctor had not forgotten the fish
when he asked the boys what they would eat for
supper. But he always appeared to have a poor
memory and few ideas when on a trip with his
Scouts. He made it a rule to compel the boys to
suggest and do every useful thing within their
power.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they prepared the meal on this occasion, as
they had done on others. Fireplaces were constructed
with stones, frying-pans were placed
over them, and the fish were soon sputtering
appetizingly. Fortunately, they still had a moderate
supply of bread, butter, jam and coffee,
so that all appetites were fairly well satisfied.</p>

<p class='c009'>The pans and coffee pots and cups were washed
in the dashing stream, the remains of the meal
were cleared away, more fuel was thrown on the
camp fire, and all gathered before it for the next
number of the unprepared program. For a few
minutes the boys chatted on the incidents of their
three days’ hike and exploration. Then one of
them suggested:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s tell stories.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A proposal of this kind under such circumstances
is always favorably received by true Boy
Scouts. There was a general note of approval,
and Dr. Byrd inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what shall it be first?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Flathead Mountain,” suggested Pickles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good!” exclaimed Frank Bowler.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And have somebody slam somebody in the
face,” proposed Clayton White, the joker of the
school. “That’ll suit ‘Bad.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank Bowler had been nicknamed “Bad” because
he was continually talking about “clipping
somebody on the jaw,” or “slamming some one in
the face,” or “putting somebody to the bad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll push you one on the chin if you don’t close
your face,” growled “Bad” in an undertone to
the last speaker.</p>

<p class='c009'>Clayton only grinned. He was not at all afraid,
as he was a year older than Frank and thought
himself stronger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, who has something more to add to the
story of Flathead?” inquired the owner of Lakefarm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have,” replied Hal Kenyon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, Hal, we’ll listen to you first,” announced
the doctor, and all became attentive with
a readiness that indicated almost military training.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c010'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />SOMETHING ABOUT DR. BYRD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It was well known how Mummy Cañon obtained
its name. High up on the face of a bluff was a
large rock, almost human in shape, in wrappings
like a mummy. Mummy Cañon had not yet attracted
the attention of sight-seers. No railroad
ran near it, and only a rattling stage-coach line
carried visitors between the nearest depot and the
small settlement of Jamestown, or “Jimtown,”
as it was popularly called, near which Dr. Byrd
had located his boys’ school.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Byrd had served many years as a physician
on English ships visiting the Orient, and, by both
inheritance and good fortune, had become wealthy.
When about fifty years old he found that the heat
and dampness of the tropical climate were undermining
his health and that he must heed the warnings
of nature. So he returned home, but in London
found that his throat still troubled him, and
he decided that he most move elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>His children being grown and married, he and
his wife sold part of their personal effects and
came to America. Then they traveled about a
good deal, trying to find a climate that would promote
better health for the doctor, but every place
they visited proved unsatisfactory until they
reached Colorado.</p>

<p class='c009'>The altitude of this state, second highest of all
the states of the Union, together with the atmospheric
conditions, proved “just the thing.” But
where should they make their home? Denver was
delightful as to climate, but the doctor was not contented
there. He loved nature, to be out of
doors; he had no patience with clanging street
cars, smoking engines, and houses huddled together.
So they began their search anew.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day they stopped at Lake City and took a
stage-coach ride over the La Garita Mountains.
The vehicle was only a rattling two-seated open
buggy, drawn by four horses that might have
pulled a plow over any American field, but it was
dignified with the name stage-coach. The driver
was a young man who had a contract with the government
for transporting mail to and from various
mining points along the way, and he added to his
profits by carrying passengers and all manner of
light freight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Along the foot of the mountains they rode for
several miles, then up a grade and around a spur
of a perpendicular hill, up, up, up, winding here
and there, overlooking deep gullies, dashing downgrade
into a ragged valley, with its noisy brook;
then up again and on and around they wound to
where the pines stuck in the mountain sides like
toothpicks.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the course of this journey they passed
through Mummy Cañon. But this gorge had not
yet received its name, and when the imaginative
Dr. Byrd beheld the “swathed form” on the face
of a lofty bluff, he called attention to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the mummy,” said the driver in a
matter-of-fact way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It looks just like an Egyptian mummy,” declared
the doctor. “Does everybody call it
that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everybody around here does.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the name of this cañon?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Tain’t got none. I s’pose it’ll get a name
one o’these days when more people settle ’round
here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s going to have one right now,” announced
the doctor. “Its name is Mummy Cañon. I call
you two as witnesses of the christening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll have to stay here a while and tell
everybody or the name won’t stick,” laughed Mrs.
Byrd.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And that’s just what I’m going to do,” was
the surprising answer. “I’m going to make my
home right near here—with your permission,
of course, my dear. This is just the country I
want to live in. It’s good for my health. It’s
good for my eyes; I like to look at it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That settled it. Mrs. Byrd was amiable and
happy to live in any place where her husband’s
health could improve. Moreover, she, too, was
delighted with the scenery and praised it almost
as much as did the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there were other features of special interest
in the cañon. This part of the state had once
been inhabited by the cliff-dwellers, prehistoric
Pueblo Indians. Ruins of their early dwellings
and defenses were to be found here and there,
although usually they were in such dilapidated
condition that it was difficult to make out their
character except at close range.</p>

<p class='c009'>The “mummy bluff” stood out high on the side
of a most remarkable mountain, especially noticeable
because of its shape. The sides looked unscalable
and the top appeared to have been cut
off clean and level with a monster knife, a few
hundred feet lower than the neighboring lofty
peaks. Before leaving the cañon, Dr. Byrd gave
a name also to this mountain. He called it Flathead.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor was well pleased with “Jimtown.”
In fact, he was pleased with everything now.
The mining settlement was booming when he and
Mrs. Byrd arrived. It was located close to the
side of a mountain; a few of the houses, in fact,
stood a short distance up on the steep slope. The
place was so busy that nobody seemed to have
time to notice the arrival of so humble a pair as
a London physician and his wife, and they selected
a site and built a home without attracting
any particular attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>The site was located near a pretty mountain-spring
lake that fed a tributary of the Rio Grande.
It was about three miles from Mummy Cañon.
The scenery of course was beautiful, as it is in all
of mountainous Colorado. The lake was clear
and cold. It rested in a pocket more than a hundred
feet above a delightful valley and behind it
was a range of tall, steep, snow-capped mountains.
The outlet was down several natural terraces that
converted the little river into a succession of dashing
cascades before it reached the valley.</p>

<p class='c009'>This place was several miles from “Jimtown,”
the nearest settlement. Dr. Byrd engaged
servants and began the cultivation of a considerable
farm. The beauty of the spot and the personality
of the settlers soon attracted attention,
and several others moved there and began the
cultivation of farms. Before long a post office
branch was opened and the stage-coach line ran
two miles out of its way to deliver mail, groceries
and general supplies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile the doctor made acquaintances rapidly.
He was a most entertaining person to meet.
He had traveled extensively and seemed to know
the world. He had an excellent library and a
magnificent collection of curios from many countries.
Moreover, he had a delightful personality,
tall, straight, athletic figure, kindly intelligent
face, and a shock of curly iron-gray hair that commanded
the admiration of all who saw it.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the doctor’s best friends were boys. And
there was a reason for this. The boys whom he
met always found in him a best friend. He knew
all about them, their likes and dislikes, their
sports and their hardships. He had a vivid recollection
of his own boyhood days, and he could
reel off yarns by the hour. Just put him into a
company of youngsters and let him begin:
“When I was a boy,” and everybody was all attention
in an instant. Of course there were not
many boys living in the neighborhood of the new
mountain home, but there were a good many in
Jimtown, where the doctor soon became a familiar
figure. And there was always company at “Lakefarm,”
as he had named the place, and the “company”
always was urged to bring the boys along.
Frequently they would remain at Lakefarm
after the grown-ups had departed, and every summer
the place became “a regular boy ranch,” as
one visitor called it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally the doctor got so interested in “boy-ology”
that he resolved to open a boys’ school.
Manual training had become quite the fashion in
the making of young men all over the country and
this appealed to the owner of Lakefarm. So he
let his ideas become known and was astonished
as well as pleased at the indorsement they received.</p>

<p class='c009'>Five years after settling at Lakefarm Dr. Byrd
built a schoolhouse and a shop and a dormitory
on his farm, engaged instructors and servants,
and then announced that he was ready to receive
pupils. It was surprising how rapidly the school
was filled. In two weeks Dr. Byrd announced
that he could receive no more, and the registry list
was closed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Most of the boys were of either wealthy or well-to-do
parents. Naturally this was an almost necessary
condition, as the tuition and living expenses
at an institution of this kind were not the
lowest. But to offset this, the doctor made arrangements
for receiving a few pupils on nominal
payments or free of charge. One of these poor
boys was Hal Kenyon, whom Dr. Byrd found selling
newspapers on a street corner in Denver.
Hal proved to be such a bright lad that the owner
of Lakefarm decided at once to do something for
him. Hal’s parents were willing and he went to
school in the mountains.</p>

<p class='c009'>Three successful and happy years had passed
since the opening of the school on Lakefarm.
Meanwhile the settlement around the school grew
until the census enumerator reported fifty families.
Previously the town had been known as
Byrd’s Place, or just Byrd’s, but now the subject
of a permanent name arose and a meeting was
called to settle the matter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Flathead was the name selected. After this
the name of the school was changed in the popular
mind. Officially it bore the title of Lakefarm
Institute, but soon it was spoken of frequently as
Flathead School, while some humorously played
on the idea suggested in the name and styled it
the “School for Level-headed Boys.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This latter pleased Dr. Byrd very well, for it
expressed his purpose in a few words, to develop
in his pupils a liberal supply of common sense.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />A FALL FROM THE AIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>That was the history of Mummy Cañon, Flathead
Mountain and Lakefarm Institute. The
mountain was partly visible from the school. On
their return to the farm from Mummy Cañon the
Boy Scouts would have to walk on through the
cañon, past old Flathead, and up the stream
that came dashing noisily down from Lakefarm
and joined Flathead River north of the big gorge.</p>

<p class='c009'>The peakless mountain was located near the
lower end of the cañon, and it was from a bluff on
the mountain side that the “mummy” stood
forth. Before the sun went down the Scouts could
see the outlines of this freak of nature from their
position at the camp fire, but as it sank beneath
the high horizon and the cañon grew dark, both
the bluff and the “mummy” were lost to view.
But presently the moon rose over Old Flathead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under such circumstances Hal Kenyon began
his legend of the cañon, relating it as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Flathead Mountain was once a giant. He
was the biggest giant that ever lived. His name
wasn’t Flathead then. His head ran up to a peak,
and the people called him Sugar Loaf.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But his heart was made of stone, the hardest
kind, and his brains were all up in the peak of his
head. And those brains didn’t amount to much,
for they had such a small place to rest in that they
were squeezed into half their natural size.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And since he didn’t have much brains and
his heart was made of stone, he was a cruel giant.
He did all kinds of mean things. He killed and ate
all the boys he could lay his hands on. There
weren’t any Boy Scouts in those days, or they’d
have gone out and killed him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d have clouted him in the jaw,” interrupted
Frank Bowler energetically. “Just one good
swift punch on the chin—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, you would, Bad,” jeered Pickles;
“you’re all the time talking about clouting somebody—but
you never do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t, eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, come, boys,” warned the doctor.
“That’s not very dignified talk for a Boy Scout,
Frank. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
It’s silly. Go ahead, Harry. We’ll let Frank
tell us how he would have licked the giant after
you’ve finished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” continued Hal, “I was going to tell
how a boy like Bad did clout the giant in the
face, or something worse, but he interrupted me.
You see it was this way. A good many years ago,
a boy called Smash lived near here. That was
before the giant lost his peak. Smash went
around smashing everybody in the face. The
giant met him in the woods one day and nodded
his head at him and said hello.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Come off the heap; don’t talk to me,’”
jeered Smash. ‘I’ll lay my mit on your mouth.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Ho, ho, ho!’ laughed the giant. ‘You’re
the conceitedest kid that ever came to this cañon.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Where’s the best place to hit you?’ asked
Smash.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Right here on my ankle,’ replied the giant.
‘You can’t reach any higher.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Let me stand on your ear, and I’ll give you
a nailer,’ said Smash.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The giant picked Smash up with two fingers
and stood him on his ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Now, let me have your axe,’ said Smash.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘What!’ roared the giant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Let me have your axe.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!’ laughed the giant. ‘You
couldn’t get your arms around the handle.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I can’t, eh? Just give it to me and I’ll knock
your brains out.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘All right, you conceited kid,’ said the giant.
‘Here it is. Bust away.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“He always carried his axe with him to cut
firewood, and he gave it to the boy. Smash’s fingers
seemed suddenly to grow very long and very
strong, for they seized the handle and lifted it up.
Then, before the giant realized what was happening,
Smash gave the axe a mighty swing and cut
the top of his head off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurrah for Smash!” exclaimed Bad.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait a minute,” said Hal. “There’s more
coming and you won’t be so happy over it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did Smash fall off his ear?” inquired one of
the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good guess,” replied Hal. “That’s just
what happened.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did he break his neck?” asked another.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know; but it was just as bad. He
fell faster than the top of the giant’s head and
the giant’s brains spilt on top of him and
drownded him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Drowned</em> him, you mean,” corrected Mr.
Porter. But the correction was not noticed. The
boys were loudly expressing their opinions of
the story. Some liked it; others were displeased.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Served him right for having the big-head,”
declared Joe Moffett wisely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You bet it did,” agreed Vincent Pyle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t either,” shouted Frank Bowler.
“That’s a crazy story. You can’t tell me. Why,
do you think a boy who could stand on a giant’s
ear and cut off the top of his head with a axe as
big as forty trees would get in such a scrape?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” replied several. “Yes,” declared
others.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re crazy,” said Bad, addressing the latter.
“Why, he’d ’a’ fell in the giant’s pocket, or
caught hold o’ one of his whiskers, or hung onto
his watch chain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a good argument,” pronounced Dr.
Byrd. “What have you to say to it, Hal?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bad’s wrong,” replied the story teller.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want you boys to quit calling Frank ‘Bad,’”
said the doctor sternly. “He isn’t bad at all.
He’s just extravagant in his talk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t care what they call me,” declared
Frank, who was rather proud of his nickname.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just so we don’t call you down, eh?” Pickles
amended.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you do, I’ll clean you up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pickles was smaller than Bad and did not resent
this threat. The doctor did not regard
Frank’s talk very seriously and so did not remonstrate.
He remembered similar experiences
of his own and believed that hard knocks are a
much better cure than constant preaching for the
brag and bluff of a boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’d you get that story?” inquired
Byron Bowler, Bad’s one-year-older brother.
“Make it up yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Pepper helped me,” replied Hal. Pepperill
Humphrey was an old servant of the doctor’s
who had traveled with him much and followed his
employer soon after the latter settled in Colorado.
He was an interesting character, one of
those old-style family servants who had grown
up with the families for whom they worked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We worked it out together,” continued Hal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you put me in it or did Pepper?” inquired
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t know you were in it,” replied Hal
with a mischievous grin plainly visible in the firelight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Smarty! You know what I mean. You
meant Smash for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I put Smash in the story, yes; but you never
did any such things as he did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal and Frank were very good friends, and
Hal knew better than to take seriously Bad’s
“fierce” attitude. He liked his warlike friend
best when he was threatening to “clean somebody
up.” There was something amusing about
him when he was making one of his idle threats.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, who’s going to tell us a story about the
mummy?” inquired Mr. Frankland.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have one on <em>that</em> if nobody else has,” announced
Dr. Byrd.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell it,” cried several of the boys eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It isn’t very long,” said the doctor; “but
it fits in well with Hal’s story. The giant, by the
way, had water on the brain: that’s why Smash
was drowned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Smash, by the way, was an Indian.
And he had a brother whose name was Rash.
This brother was continually doing the most outlandish
things and performing the most wonderful
feats. After the top of the giant’s head was
cut off and his brains gone, the giant died. But
as he was very stockily built, he did not fall over,
but continued to stand there. Trees and bushes
and grass and flowers grew all over and he became
a mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Rash was a witness of the death of
Smash. He was sailing above in an airship—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In an airship!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, why not?” he replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who ever heard of Indians having airships!”
said Bad in tones of disgust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This Indian was a real inventor,” explained
Dr. Byrd. “But he kept the secrets of all his
inventions to himself, so that when he died all his
work died with him. When he saw the fearful
accident that had befallen his brother, he glided
down to offer assistance. The giant was dead,
although standing erect; but Smash had disappeared,
all but one foot. That was sticking out
from under the hollow peak of the giant’s head,
which had fallen over the boy and caged him in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rash alighted and attempted to turn the peak
over; but although he was very strong, he was
unable to do this. So he flew away, and a few days
later he returned with several other Indians.
With the aid of some tree trunks for levers they
elevated one side of the peak-prison and pulled out
the body of the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The brain of the giant proved to have been a
most remarkable substance. It had a strong odor
of spices and chemicals and had converted
Smash’s body into a mummy. The flesh was becoming
hard as stone and it was evident that no
decay could follow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Although Rash was a reckless and daring
fellow, he had not the great fault that had brought
Smash to a sad end. He appreciated the danger
of such a nature and desired to warn all others
against a like fate. So he wrapped the body in
cloths, as some of the Indian tribes have done,
and saturated the cloths with diluted giant’s
brain to preserve them. Then he put the body on
his airship and arose to the giant’s forehead,
and landed with his burden on a beetling eyebrow.
There he hewed out a shallow niche, into
which, he set the mummified Smash and cemented
him fast; and on the giant’s forehead he remains
to-day as a warning not only to boys who are continually
threatening to clean some one up, but
also to giants who may be so foolish as to put
great power into the hands of boastful youths.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Everybody except Frank applauded this story.
After the hand-clapping and shouts of glee had
subsided, Bad remarked disdainfully:</p>

<p class='c009'>“That story’s all bunk. The mummy on the
mountain’s as big as a elephant. How could it
have been a boy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, those Indians were giants themselves,
though they weren’t anything like as big as Flathead,”
exclaimed Dr. Byrd.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment all were startled by a most remarkable
noise. It was a heavy whirring sound
and came from overhead. Instinctively they all
looked up and beheld in the moonlight a very
strange object. But, strange though it was, every
one of the boys recognized its nature almost immediately.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s an airship,” cried one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An aeroplane,” shouted another.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s volplaning,” exclaimed Dr. Byrd in
startled tones. “I wonder what he means. He
can’t be going to land here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He seems to be in trouble,” said Mr. Frankland.
“Yes, he’s coming down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look out, everybody!” shouted Dr. Byrd.
“No telling where he’ll land.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no need of a second warning. Evidently
the aviator was losing control of his machine.
It acted as if one wing had been clipped.
Suddenly, within fifty feet of the ground, the
aeroplane plunged and fell with a crash and a
thud less than a hundred feet from the camp
fire.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c010'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />THE WRECK AND THE AVIATOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For some moments all was commotion. The
appearance of the aeroplane in that out-of-the-way
place and at such a time had been so unexpected
as to create no little confusion, but when
it plunged to earth almost in the very midst of the
camping Scouts, there was general panic, accompanied
by a few screams of fright.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every boy, as well as the doctor and the two
instructors, ran for cover as the warning was
sounded, but few of them found a satisfactory
place before the aeroplane struck. Luckily nobody
was hit, and soon they gathered around the
wreck in true Boy Scout readiness to help the
injured.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunately the aviator had not been caught
under the wreckage. He had managed to jump
clear of his machine before it struck the earth,
so that his body was not mangled. But he lay
still as death, and there was little doubt in the
minds of the campers that the fall had been fatal.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Byrd was soon kneeling over the unconscious
form and examining it for signs of life.
Two of the boys pulled burning brands from the
fire and held them close to afford him light. The
examination occupied several minutes, and finally
the doctor announced:</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s alive, but he’s got some broken bones.
One of you boys get some water. Some of you
make some splints, and some make a coat litter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In a moment all was activity. Thirty boys
cannot work together to great advantage under
ordinary circumstances, but these boys were well
trained and well managed. They were organized
in Patrols with Patrol Leaders, while the two instructors
acted as Scout Masters. All of them,
even Bad, had learned to obey orders, and the
work moved along quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pickles went to the stream and got some water
in a coffee pot, and Hal led a company into a
clump of cottonwood near by to cut some splints,
while others busied themselves with the preparing
of the litter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The splints were made of small green limbs
cut from some of the trees and shaved flat on two
sides with the boys’ strong jackknives. In a
short time Hal and his followers were back on
the scene of the accident, watching proceedings
eagerly and waiting for further orders. Meanwhile
the work on the litter progressed with equal
rapidity. Two strong poles were cut, trimmed
and thrust through the arms of two of the boys’
coats. Then the fronts were drawn around over
the poles and buttoned, and the task was finished.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Byrd was a surgeon as well as a physician
and he worked rapidly. He laid the injured man
flat on his back, with head low, opened his clothing
to aid respiration, then bared the injured
parts and bathed them with water. In a few
minutes the man groaned, and it was evident that
he was in great pain. A further examination disclosed
the fact that his right leg and two ribs on
his right side were broken.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Byrd did not set the leg at once. He merely
straightened the limb and bound it with handkerchiefs
and pieces of torn garments so as to make
it firm at the broken point. Around the broken
ribs he pinned a wide bandage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You boys are now having your first lesson in
the treatment of a victim of a serious accident,”
remarked the doctor after he had finished his
work. “Sometime one of you may be in a position
where you’ll have to set a broken bone, and
it will be well for you all to make note of everything
connected with this case. First, never set
a bone when the flesh around the fracture is swollen.
Treat it to reduce the swelling, and then set
it. This man’s wounds are badly swollen because
of the violence of his fall. I have bound them so
that they will not be irritated while he is being
carried to Lakefarm. Now, we’ll put him on the
litter and start. But first put out the fire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys quickly obeyed, for they had been
taught never to leave a camp fire unattended in a
place where there was a possibility of the blaze
reaching woods or prairie grass. There was little
danger in this instance, but the doctor insisted
on following the rule. Water was carried in pails
and pots and pans from the stream and poured
on the fire until the last spark was gone. Then
the camping utensils were gathered up and the
journey toward the school was resumed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Frankland and Mr. Porter carried the injured
man, and Dr. Byrd walked beside the litter
and kept watch over the patient. The latter had
said little thus far, for the doctor had instructed
him to lie still and not try to tell his story, as he
evidently wished to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>The aviator was about thirty years old, and one
look into his pain-drawn face was enough to inspire
confidence and deep sympathy. He was not
particularly handsome but he looked pleasant and
straightforward. His body seemed well-knit and
powerful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll give you boys a half holiday to-morrow
morning,” announced the doctor as they started
up the cañon toward Flat Head Pass. “You may
come back here and get the wreck of the airship
and bring it back to the school.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This announcement delighted the young Scouts,
who expressed their glee variously. The prospect
of making a thorough examination of an aeroplane
with such a history as this, was enough to
excite their imaginations.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they proceeded, the doctor gave the boys
further instructions regarding the care of an injured
person. He called their attention to the
manner in which the man on the stretcher was
being carried in order that he might ride with the
greatest possible care and comfort.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Notice how Mr. Frankland and Mr. Porter are
walking,” he said. “They break their step so
that while one moves his right leg the other moves
his left and vice versa. This makes an easy pace.
By walking in this manner, Mr. Frankland and
Mr. Porter carry the patient along gently and
without jarring.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was after ten o’clock when they arrived at the
school. The aviator was taken into the “Hospital,”
put into bed and made as comfortable as
possible. The boys went to their dormitory, visited
the shower baths and then turned in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next morning, in spite of their late retirement,
the boys were up bright and early. Several of
them had dreamed of airships and awoke in the
midst of various tragic situations. Hal Kenyon
narrowly escaped being hit by the wing of a falling
biplane and awoke as the machine struck the
ground with a crash. Those who were slow at
waking were pulled out of bed by their more eager
schoolmates or were driven out of slumberland
with showers of pillows. But they were not angry
in the least at this rough awakening and made all
possible haste to prepare for breakfast.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were few servants at the “Level-Headed
School.” Dr. Byrd did not permit any of the boys
to wear expensive clothes, even on Sunday. For
the week days he had selected the Boy Scout uniforms,
which were worn constantly. This uniform,
in fact, was what attracted him to the Boy
Scout idea.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the absence of a corps of servants, the young
Scouts learned to perform many useful duties.
They aired their own rooms and made their own
beds, sewed on their own buttons, and, in shifts,
helped the cook to prepare their meals.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they had various “chores” to perform both
before and after breakfast on the morning following
their “hike” in the mountains. For an hour
and a half they were busy, sandwiching their
breakfast between the tidying of the dormitory
and the washing and wiping of dishes. But finally
all such duties were done, and the boys were free
to go to Mummy Cañon for the wrecked aeroplane.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile they had been told that the victim
of the accident was not fatally injured. Aside
from his broken ribs and leg he had suffered only
a severe shaking up. A thorough examination had
convinced the doctor that he would recover as
soon as his broken bones could mend. The swelling
on his leg was rapidly going down, and the
doctor announced that he would probably set the
limb in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>A team of horses was hitched to a wagon, and
one of the boys got in and drove, while the rest
walked ahead or behind. Mr. Frankland accompanied
them. The journey was uneventful and in
less than an hour they were in the cañon.</p>

<p class='c009'>The aeroplane was so thoroughly a wreck as
to require almost an expert to determine what it
had been originally. It had struck on a level
grassy spot and had torn up the sod as if to make
the earth as much a wreck as itself. A misshapen
mass of splintered wood and bent struts and
braces was about all that the Scouts could make
out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s hardly worth while to take that junk back
with us,” said Mr. Frankland as he gazed on the
sorry-looking heap. “But since we came after
it we may as well obey orders. Perhaps he’ll
want to hold a funeral and bury his dead pet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is he?” inquired Ferdinand Sharer,
commonly known as “Fes” because of his fondness
of carving or inking his initials, “F. E. S.,”
on all his personal property. “What’s his
name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know,” Mr. Frankland replied. “He
hasn’t done much talking yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gee! such a fall as that’s enough to shut
anybody up,” exclaimed Frank Bowler.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, anybody except you,” answered “Fes”
wisely. “You never close your face till after
the chickens go to roost.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t, eh!” began Frank; but Mr. Frankland
put a stop to this sort of dispute by saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tut, tut, boys. None of that. That isn’t
clever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Several of the boys now took hold of the wreck
and lifted it into the wagon. It was a strange
looking sight as they carted it over the rock road.</p>

<p class='c009'>They arrived back at Lakefarm earlier than
they had expected, but the boys were not required
to return to their class work until afternoon. The
wreck of the aeroplane was stored away in an
empty shed, and the incident was closed pending
an explanation from the injured aviator.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c010'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />LOST!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Next day Dr. Byrd related an aeroplane story
to the boys in the assembly room. It was the
story of Mr. Johnson Miles, the aviator who lay
on a bed in the “Hospital” striving to help mend
his broken bones by thinking hopeful thoughts.
It was a story of absorbing interest to the young
Scouts and afforded material for much excited
conversation for several days thereafter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Miles had related his experiences in detail.
He said that his home was in Indianapolis and
that he had flown all the way from that city in his
aeroplane. He had already spent several weeks
among and over the mountains, his purpose being
to visit the Rockies as a bird would visit them, and
to collect specimens.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was on my way to Flathead Mountain when
I fell almost at its base,” he told the doctor. “It
was moonlight and I thought I would fly awhile,
as it is really mighty pleasant to sail through the
air with the moon and stars overhead. It’s like
racing along a lonely road in an automobile and
seeing a ghost behind every post.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have an odd idea of enjoyment,” remarked
the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it’s thrilling,” declared the aviator.
“The ghosts can’t catch you in an automobile,
and you just cut right through them in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I was forced to stay up longer than I
wanted to. The country was so rough that I
could find no place to land. Then I found my
gasoline almost gone and I knew I must glide
and take my chances. The engine began to jerk
and sputter and gasp, warning me of immediate
danger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was a bad miscalculation I made regarding
my gasoline. I thought I had enough
to last me several hours. I had intended to fly
only an hour or two by moonlight. I was right
over the mountains when I discovered the condition
of my gasoline, and you can imagine the state
of mind it threw me into. All the ghosts I had
cut through in the air hadn’t begun to chill me the
way this did. Fifty thousand icicles stuck down
my back wouldn’t have been a circumstance to
this.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was so dark down on the earth, in spite of
the moon, that I could hardly distinguish mountains
from valleys. I was flying five hundred feet
over the highest peaks, and began to glide as soon
as I discovered my predicament.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Presently I saw a large gulch that you call
Mummy Cañon right below me. So I banked and
circled around without realizing that I was so near
the mountain I was searching for. But when about
fifty feet from the ground a couple of my stay
wires broke and warped the left wing. I worked
my ailerons in an endeavor to balance the machine,
but it was no use. Down she flopped, and
I leaped. I don’t know how I managed to get
clear of the struts and the planes, but I did, and—well,
it was mighty lucky you folks were near,
or I’d have died a lonely death. Probably nobody
would’ve come that way until I was food
for the crows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What became of your specimens?” inquired
the doctor. “Didn’t you have any with you, or
hadn’t you gathered any yet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my, yes!” replied Miles. “I’d been in
the mountains several weeks. Didn’t you find
them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. Where did you drop them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They were in a leather bag tied to one of the
struts near my seat. It’s mighty funny you
didn’t find them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe the bag was broken loose when the
machine struck the ground, and was thrown some
distance away,” suggested the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That might be, but I should think one of all
those boys would have found it when they went
after the aeroplane.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I should think so, too, unless it fell into
a hole or behind a big rock. Were the contents
of the bag valuable?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wouldn’t have taken one thousand dollars
for them,” said the aviator sadly. “In fact, I
regret their loss more than the wreck of the biplane.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll make a thorough search for them,”
assured the doctor as he left his patient.</p>

<p class='c009'>This conversation took place shortly before
noon. After dinner the boys were instructed to
meet in the assembly room. There the doctor retold
Mr. Miles’ story in detail and then said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to give you another half holiday,
boys—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hooray!” exclaimed Ferdinand Sharer in a
loud whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold on, Ferdinand. Shut off your enthusiasm,
for this isn’t going to be an occasion of
play. You have a very serious duty to perform,
and I want you to go about it seriously.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will,” assured several of the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know you intend to be serious,” said
the owner of Lakefarm, with a wise shake of his
iron-gray locks. “But I want you to be more
than serious. I want you to use your wits, too, a
little. A treasure has been lost and I want you
to go in search of it; and if you don’t find it, I
want you to furnish a clew as to what has become
of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Byrd’s Boy Scouts could no longer contain
themselves. Most of them just had to give vent
to their feelings with loud-whispered “hoorays!”
or other characteristic expressions of
glee.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Remember, now,” insisted the master of the
school just before he instructed the troop of
Scouts to file out; “I want you to use your heads
and do some good work. That bag of relics is
valuable and must be found. If it isn’t lying on
the ground near the place where the aeroplane
struck, I want to know why. Mr. Porter will go
with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was rather a large task to impose on any
number of boys. To be sure, if the bag were lying
near the spot in question, they ought to find it,
or rather they should have discovered it already;
but if it had mysteriously disappeared, how were
thirty boys to conjure an explanation of the mystery?</p>

<p class='c009'>Naturally this question, variously phrased, occurred
to a number of the Scouts as they listened
to the doctor’s latest words, but they were too
young to ponder very deeply over the difficulty of
any problem and soon dismissed this one from
their minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may stay until dark if it takes that long
to find it,” concluded Dr. Byrd. “Now, everybody
go to the kitchen and get some sandwiches
that you’ll find all ready. You’ll all be hungry
before you get back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no need of further urging. The
boys filed eagerly out of the room, hastened to
their lockers and got their drab coats, drill hats,
haversacks, and hike-sticks, and then went to the
kitchen for their sandwiches. In twenty minutes
they were on their way.</p>

<p class='c009'>The course from the school to Mummy Cañon
is pretty and interesting. It follows the bed of
the river most of the way. This stream, named
Lake River by Dr. Byrd, varies from thirty to
forty feet wide and carries considerable volume of
water. It runs southward a mile and a half along
the foothills, then turns westward after receiving
the water of Flathead River from Mummy
Cañon. The rest of the way is up-hill, along the
bank of the latter river or near it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mummy Cañon is more than two miles long, its
greatest width, near the center, being nearly half
a mile. It is almost entirely hemmed in by mountains,
there being a narrow pass at either end,
north and south. Flathead River has its source,
or sources, high up in the mountains, and dashes
down in a series of noisy cascades and cataracts,
making a graceful curve for a quarter of a mile
along the base of Flathead Mountain, from there
leaping down a very rocky course to and through
the northern pass.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young Scouts and Mr. Porter walked halfway
through the cañon before they reached the
place where the aeroplane struck the earth. To
the west arose Flathead Mountain, considerably
lower than the other mountains bordering the
cañon. From the “forehead” of Flathead the
mummy stood forth conspicuously. The bottom
of the cañon was strewn with bowlders of every
size and description. On the east, exactly opposite
Flathead, was a steep ascent so rocky as to
permit of little vegetation save a pine or fir here
and there growing from a crevice that seemed not
to contain a trace of soil. High up on the ascent
were poised several huge bowlders, and hence
its name of Bowlder Mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>On a level and treeless spot several acres in
extent between Flathead and Bowlder Mountain,
the Boy Scouts and Mr. Porter began their
search for the missing bag of specimens. Almost
in the middle of the grassy plot, the sod had been
torn and rooted up by the plunging machine, and
it did not take the searchers long to decide that
the object they sought was not there in the open.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what do you think of it, boys?” inquired
Mr. Porter. “Remember, you’re to do all
the work and furnish all the ideas. Who has an
idea now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have,” announced Fes Sharer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right. We’ll listen to Ferdinand first.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think this is all a pipe dream of the airship
man’s,” declared Fes, who was an extremely
practical youth and always demanded evidence
before he would believe anything. “I think he
struck his head on a rock and hasn’t come to his
senses yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you believe he had a bag of souvenirs?”
inquired the instructor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Naw,” was the skeptical answer. “If he did,
what became of it? It’d had to fall with the airship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, if it was tied to it,” conditioned Juan
Del Mar.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He says it was tied to the aeroplane,” reminded
Mr. Porter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think he’s dreaming,” insisted Fes. “If
he had a bag of specimens with him, it wasn’t
tied to the airship; or if it was, it broke loose or
came untied while it was falling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think it came untied,” declared Pickles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do the rest of you think?” inquired
Mr. Porter.</p>

<p class='c009'>As any thought on the subject must be largely
a matter of guess, none of the boys besides Fes
and Pickles were inclined to be very positive.
All, however, were willing to accept Ferdinand’s
explanation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then it’s up to us to search the whole cañon,
or a good piece of it, around here,” declared Hal
Kenyon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several others agreed with him, although a
few of the more doubtful said they were just as
ready to believe that the bag had been dropped
outside of the cañon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I bet it dropped right on the peak of Bowlder
Mountain, or maybe on the top of Flathead,”
one boy even declared.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was now half past three o’clock, and as it
would be dark early in the cañon, the boys set to
work diligently to cover as much ground as possible
before daylight failed them. They divided
up the territory, and each boy tried to confine
his search to his assignment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal had a stretch of several acres along the
creek at the base of Flathead Mountain. In the
course of an hour he went over it thoroughly,
without finding the treasured bag and hearing no
joyful cry of discovery from any of the other boys.
Meanwhile it occurred to him that the bag might
just as well have fallen into the river as any other
place, and he determined to search in the water
also.</p>

<p class='c009'>This required a good deal of time. In some of
the wider places the stream was shallow and he
could see the stony or pebbly bottom. But in
other places he found it necessary to exercise
greater care. He took off his shoes and stockings
and rolled up his trousers as high as he could;
then he waded in and began a thorough search.
Where the water was too deep for wading, he
used his hike-stick to feel the bottom.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime other boys, to whom had been
assigned other sections along the creek, observed
what Hal was doing and followed his example.
The search went along quietly, for all of the
Scouts were too widely separated to engage in
much conversation. When they became hungry,
they ate their sandwiches and drank spring water
and then returned to their work.</p>

<p class='c009'>But at last it grew too dark for further hunting
among the rocks, trees and bushes, or even in the
open, and Mr. Porter called them together. The
search seemed to have been in vain. The leather
bag of the aviator was still lost, and nobody believed
that it would ever be found, unless by accident.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we did our best anyway,” said Byron
Bowler.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You bet we did, Bun,” agreed Pickles, following
the general boy habit of shortening Byron
to “Bun.” “I’m tired.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So’m I,” declared several others.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll start home now,” announced Mr. Porter.
“Everybody here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All here,” replied one of the boys, assuming
that everybody had answered Mr. Porter’s
whistle.</p>

<p class='c009'>The walk back to Lakefarm was quiet. The
boys were all tired and found little of interest to
discuss in their fruitless search. On the campus
they were met by Dr. Byrd and Mr. Frankland,
who inquired as to their success.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing doing,” replied Roy Hendricks.
“We searched pretty near the whole cañon and
come back with empty hands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and we searched the river, too,” repeated
Bun. “Hal Kenyon started that. We
waded through the shallow places.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is Hal?” inquired Pickles. “I ain’t
seen him all the way back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that?” inquired the doctor. “Kenyon
missing? Hal, step forward.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no answer and no stepping forward.
All was excitement soon. Hal’s name was called,
then shouted by a dozen throats, and still no reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>Young Kenyon had disappeared as mysteriously
as had the bag of specimens of the injured
aviator.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c010'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />THE SCREAM IN THE WATERFALL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“How did this happen, Mr. Porter?” demanded
Dr. Byrd sternly, yet with an unmistakable
quaver in his voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I don’t know, sir,” stammered the manual
training instructor. “I thought I heard his
voice among the others on the way home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The fact was, Mr. Porter thought no such thing.
He was merely frightened lest he be held responsible
if anything serious had happened to
Kenyon while the boy was in his charge. He felt
guilty. He knew that he ought to have called
the roll to determine if all were present before
starting back for the school.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did anybody see Hal or hear his voice on
the way back?” called out the doctor addressing
the crowd of boys now gathered closely around
him. No one had.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe he’s gone into the dining-room,” suggested
Mr. Porter in an unnatural tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, he didn’t do anything of the sort,”
returned the doctor. “I’ve been sitting out here
for ten minutes waiting for you. Not a boy has
entered this building in that time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was an uncomfortable silence for a few
moments, and then the doctor continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If anything has happened to that boy I’m going
to find out who’s responsible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was working in the river some o’ the time
and it’s over his head, lots of places,” piped one
small boy in fearful accents.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it’s impossible for him to have been
drowned,” declared Mr. Porter. “I kept my eyes
on the boys in the river all the time they were
there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Byrd offered no reply to this assurance.
He merely said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“All you boys go in and get your supper; then
go to bed early.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t we go with you and hunt for Hal?”
pleaded Charley Mason.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. I’m not going to run any risk of losing
any more of you. Besides, you’ve done enough
for one day. I know you’re all tired.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No we’re not,” responded several. The fact
is, they were well tired from their afternoon’s
work, but love for their lost schoolmate had a refreshing
effect. But the master of the school
would not yield and they were forced to do as he
said.</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time Mr. Frankland had appeared, and
as the boys filed into the wash room to prepare
for supper, he was informed of the situation that
had caused such a commotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got to go and look for that boy and
stick to the hunt until we find him—dead or
alive,” almost sobbed the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it can’t be as bad as that,” reassured
the hopeful Mr. Frankland. “Hal’s a pretty
level-headed boy and will be showing up with an
explanation before long. I haven’t known him to
get into trouble yet, and nearly every other boy
in the school has been in one sort of scrape or another.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope you’re right, Frankland, but I very
much fear otherwise. I can’t conceive of an explanation
of his disappearance unless some serious
accident has befallen him. But you go and
find Pepper and have him get the auto ready, Mr.
Porter; and, Mr. Frankland, you get a couple of
long-handled rakes and some lanterns. I’ll get
my medical and surgical cases and we’ll be prepared
for any emergency.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pepper was soon found and instructed. A few
words of explanation served to put speed in his
actions, and in fifteen minutes the large touring
car was backed out of the garage.</p>

<p class='c009'>No unnecessary delay was permitted by the
doctor. The medical and surgical cases were put
aboard and all climbed in. Mr. Frankland, with
two rakes in hand, sat behind with Mr. Porter,
who had charge of the lanterns, and Dr. Byrd took
a seat in front with the chauffeur.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pepperill Humphrey served as chauffeur as well
as janitor at Lakefarm Institute. He was a wise
old man, always ready with “home-remedy” advice
and droll humor. He could tell “bad boys”
what was going to become of them more forebodingly,
some said, than could any other forecaster
of human events.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was peculiarly quiet on the present occasion.
After receiving a twenty-word explanation from
Mr. Frankland, he asked one or two questions and
then said nothing more. His silence might have
been construed variously. He was fond of Hal,
as was everybody else at the school, and possibly
he was stunned at the news received. But he was
observed several times to nod his head vigorously
and to mutter in a very positive manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other members of the search party, however,
were too much occupied with their own
thoughts to ask for an explanation from the
janitor-chauffeur. They rode along in silence for
most of the way. The doctor had gained all the
information that seemed obtainable. Mr. Porter,
because of the criticism he had received, wished
to draw as little attention to himself as possible,
and Mr. Frankland appreciated the embarrassment
of the situation.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a fairly good road from the school
to the northern pass of the cañon, including a
bridge over Lake River near its junction with
Flathead River, which ran through the cañon, and
along this they advanced close to the spot where
the airship had struck. Here they stopped, and
the search for Hal was started.</p>

<p class='c009'>First they shouted his name again and again,
permitting the echoes to die away after each
shout; but no reply came. Then they lighted their
lanterns, one for each, and started in pairs up and
down the bank of the river.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Porter indicated the section of the stream
along which Hal had conducted his hunt for Mr.
Miles’ bag of souvenirs, and it was from a middle
point in this section that search for the missing
boy began. For a few hundred feet here the water
was deep and comparatively quiet; but above this
calmer stretch was a succession of falls so noisy
as to make it necessary to shout in order to be
heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>The largest and noisiest of these falls was the
lowest one. Dr. Byrd and Mr. Porter went upstream
as far as this cataract, and stood a short
time gazing into the water. There was little comfort
in the feelings that possessed them as they
gazed. The falling water glittered in the yellow
moonlight, seeming to shine forth with a million
ghost eyes, and in the noise of that tumbling
flood every now and then they heard a strange
sharp sound that seemed to pierce them through.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Porter took hold of the doctor’s sleeve and
drew him away. They walked some distance
down stream until their ordinary voices could be
heard, and then Mr. Porter said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s not begin by raking the river. If he’s
drowned, we can’t do anything for him; but if he’s
injured, he needs our aid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, where would you suggest that we hunt
first?” inquired the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the timber and thickets near the falls. He
may have gone in there and got hurt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right. We’ll search every place you suggest
before we rake the river.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Frankland and Pepper were now observed
coming up along the shore, and the doctor and Mr.
Porter waited for them.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the four were reunited, Mr. Frankland
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve covered the ground pretty well down
there. Everything’s open and fairly level. We
measured the water with our rake, too, and it isn’t
over a boy’s head any place, although it is swift
as a millrace.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If he’s drowned, his body’s probably in this
deeper part near the falls,” said Dr. Byrd.
“We’re going up in the timber and hunt there
first, and then come back here if we don’t find
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It might be just possible that he waded over
to the other side and was hunting along the steep
base of old Flathead and fell in there,” suggested
Mr. Frankland.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll hope not,” returned the doctor; “but
we’ll follow that up after we’ve tried everything
else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The timber they now proceeded to search consisted
principally of spruce, pines and cottonwood
growing on a slope that ascended with the bed of
the stream. The soil was fairly good here, being
comparatively free from small stones and gravel,
but there were numerous large bowlders and rocky
projections that the search-party had to climb over
or around.</p>

<p class='c009'>They spent an hour and a half, walking, crawling
and climbing over this difficult ground, flashing
their lanterns into every hole or depression,
and stopping every now and then to call Hal’s
name. At last, considerably disheartened, they
returned to the bank of the river below the falls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go down to the rapids and work up,”
suggested Mr. Porter. “He was working that
way most of the time I think. I saw him down
there and didn’t see him up here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This proposal was agreed upon, so they walked
down stream two hundred yards from the largest
and lowest fall and began to work up. Two of the
men held the lanterns, while the others thrust the
long-handled rakes into the water and felt along
the bank.</p>

<p class='c009'>They pushed the rakes out as far as they could
and drew them in many times. On several occasions
they were almost certain they had found the
body of the missing boy, but their discovery
proved to be only a log or a tangled mass of sticks
and weeds. Finally they worked up to the lower
waterfall and then moved away from the roaring
noise to a distance where they could hear each
other talk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The only thing that seems to be left to do is
to go to the other side and rake the river bed over
there,” remarked Mr. Frankland.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and if he was drowned even on that side,
it’ll be just our luck not to find him,” said Mr.
Porter. “The body’s probably drifted into midstream
and may be down past the rapids.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we don’t find him to-night, we’ll come back
again to-morrow and drag the river to its junction
with Lake River,” the doctor announced determinedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s something funny about them falls,”
remarked Pepper, who had been strangely silent
during the whole of the search thus far.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that?” inquired Mr. Porter, who was
still nervous and easily drawn into almost any
meaningless conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you hear it?” explained the chauffeur.
“That noise every little bit. Sounds like a scream
coming right out of the water.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, that’s natural enough,” declared the manual
training instructor. “It’s a twist or eddy
sucking into some crevice in the rocks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe it,” insisted Pepper. “Many
a time I’ve been here on Sunday afternoon and set
here listenin’ to them falls, an’ never before heard
that noise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you think it is—a ghost?” inquired
Mr. Porter with an uneasy laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir,” replied the other indignantly. “But
it’s something ’at ought to be looked into. We’re
huntin’ for a missin’ boy, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There <em>is</em> something strange in that sound,”
put in Dr. Byrd at this point. “I wonder what
it can be. Mr. Porter, your explanation doesn’t
satisfy me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nor me either,” said Mr. Frankland.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then another and louder scream came
seemingly right out of the tumbling flood, thrilling
fearfully every member of the boy-hunting party.
For a few moments everybody present stood as if
frozen to the ground; then Dr. Byrd sprang forward
exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on; we’ve got to find out what that
means.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c010'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />A BADLY FRIGHTENED BOY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“I told ’em so. I told ’em something would
happen. I warned those boys they’d get into
trouble if they didn’t quit gettin’ so gay. Hal
isn’t a gay one, but he can easy be a victim of a
trick of one o’ those careless, dare-devil kids.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Frankland and Mr. Porter both heard
Pepper mutter thus to himself as they followed the
doctor toward the waterfall whence the scream of a
human voice seemed to come, but they paid little
attention to his words, for they knew his peculiarities
and attached little importance to his grumbling.
Nevertheless, Pepper believed all he said,
and more. Only a few days earlier he had
observed some of the boys engaged in tying the
long grass across the path that led from the stables
to the west timberland on Lakefarm. Then he
lectured them, promising that they would come to
no happy end.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You boys will be the death of somebody one
o’ these fine days, and then you’ll begin to do some
thinkin’,” he declared, as he strode along, breaking
with a strong kick each of the “trips” that
the mischievous youngsters had prepared. “And
you, Frank Bowler, are well nicknamed ‘Bad.’
If you don’t end on the gallows, I’m dreamin’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank seemed to be the leader in this escapade.
He would have liked to have made a smart reply
to this direful prophecy, but for once in his life
he thought twice.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was only one of many occasions of which
the old Englishman took advantage to hand out
his advice. He was really a good-hearted and
well-intending fellow, and no doubt did some of
the boys considerable good. But there were a
few of the latter who couldn’t “go the old
geezer,” and Frank Bowler was one of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why it was, he could never tell; but Mr. Humphrey
had a “feeling in his bones” that one of the
mischief makers of the school was connected with
the disappearance of Hal Kenyon. And this was
what he meant when he muttered the words overheard
by Mr. Frankland and Mr. Porter. Although
he was the one who called particular attention to
the strange sound that seemed to issue from the
waterfall, he did not regard it as seriously as did
the others. He was thinking more of certain
boys back at the school than of the mystery close
at hand. True, his wonder was aroused at the
sound issuing from the cataract, but his reason
would not permit him to connect that with the disappearance
of Hal. He was wishing that he were
now back at Lakefarm closeted with “some of
those bad boys and sweating the truth out o’
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d get it out o’ them, I’d get it out o’ them,”
he told himself over and over again after the first
thrill of awe at the shrill sound from the waterfall.
“Whether there’s anything serious happened to
Hal or not, I believe some o’ those boys know something
about it. Wait till to-morrow morning, and
I’ll find out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pepper nodded his head and shook his fist determinedly
as he spoke. He was talking vehemently
now, articulating his words without reserve, for
they had approached so near the noisy falls that
he could not hear himself speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he was interrupted by another scream from
the cataract. This was no louder than the last
preceding, but it was more thrilling, for they were
closer. Every member of the searching party
would have declared that only a human throat
could send forth such a sound.</p>

<p class='c009'>They approached close to the cataract and gazed
helplessly into the water. What could they do?
It was a most astonishing and unfathomable mystery.
All they could do was stand and look and
listen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Dr. Byrd pulled a sleeve of each of
his companions and motioned them to follow him.</p>

<p class='c009'>They started down the stream again, but soon
they were halted involuntarily by another wailing
cry from the same source. Dr. Byrd did not turn
back, however, but went on after a moment’s hesitation.
The others followed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond the reach of the deafening noise of the
waterfall, the doctor stopped and began to discuss
the affair with trembling, hollow voice, his face
showing white in the rays of the lanterns. He was
not frightened, but the circumstances were unusual
enough to unstring his nerves.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rest were similarly affected, even Pepper
experiencing a weakening of his knees as a result
of the last two screams.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What in the world does that mean?” gasped
the doctor. “There it goes again,” as another
scream, somewhat fainter than the last two,
reached their ears. “Can’t one of you offer a
possible explanation?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe it’s a mountain lion or a lynx,” suggested
Pepper. “You know there’s said to be a
few in the mountains around here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a brilliant idea,” exclaimed Dr. Byrd
enthusiastically, “or rather, it’s a commonsense
explanation that ought to have occurred to any
blockhead. Hence, what are the rest of us? I
feel better all of a sudden. But no! If it is a
panther—”</p>

<p class='c009'>He hesitated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What then?” inquired Mr. Frankland.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It may explain, may it not, what became of
Hal?” replied the doctor slowly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean that the beast killed him?”
inquired Mr. Porter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, that would have been impossible. Such
a tragedy could not have escaped the notice of
some of us. Moreover, there’d have been some
traces left—blood, broken bushes, and maybe
torn-up sod.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, that’s true,” admitted the doctor. “But
what’s become of the boy? I’d face a hundred
panthers to get Hal back safe. My! there’s that
scream again. It doesn’t sound like a wild animal.
It’s almost human.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If it’s a panther or a lynx, where do you suppose
it is?” inquired Mr. Frankland, addressing
Pepper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the rocks near the waterfall somewhere,”
replied Pepper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think we’d have seen him or have
been able to locate him when we were up close,”
reasoned the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s too dark up there—the fall’s right in the
shadow of the mountain. And the noise o’ the
water confuses things so you can’t tell just where
the scream comes from.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t believe any wild animal makes that
noise, and I’m in favor of making further investigation,”
said Dr. Byrd.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m with you on that,” Mr. Frankland
announced; “but before we proceed, I propose we
arm ourselves against a possible encounter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How?” Mr. Porter asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“With clubs. Four of us ought to beat off a
panther with good strong heavy sticks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a wise precaution,” the doctor approved.
“Let’s get busy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They proceeded to a near-by thicket and there
found a number of young trees that suited their
purpose admirably. Like the Boy Scouts, they
too were supplied with large sharp jackknives, and
in ten minutes each was armed with a club that
seemed formidable enough to break the skull of a
lion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then they turned again toward the cataract,
advancing close to it and flashing their lanterns
over the big tumble of water and the adjoining
piles of rocks. But they discovered nothing that
suggested an explanation of the mystery. The
screams continued to come, seemingly from the
fall, but it was ridiculous to believe that any living
being, human or beast, could exist in that flood
and, with clear, strong lungs, emit such wailing
sounds of distress.</p>

<p class='c009'>For fifteen minutes they watched and listened,
while the cries continued to come at intervals of
a minute or two. Finally, since the examination
of the fall and the rocks near it produced no result,
Dr. Byrd began to give all his attention to the
cries themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>After close and careful listening he was certain
he could distinguish a feature in the cries that had
not attracted his notice before. He strained every
nerve in order to catch the sounds more distinctly.
Observing his attitude as he leaned forward and
put his hand cup-shaped behind his ear, the other
men followed his example and soon they too were
certain they could make out a single word uttered
by a human voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Help!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed to come more clearly now and was
repeated several times in rapid succession. The
eager listeners turned to each other and nodded
their heads significantly; then they listened again
as the call was repeated. But only the one word
could they make out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are you, Hal?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Byrd shouted this answer to the appeal, but
his voice was heavy, attuned almost to the noise
of the waterfall, and could hardly have been heard
by the person in distress. Then Mr. Frankland
and Pepper measured the strength of their vocal
organs against the noise of the cataract with little
better result. But Mr. Porter had a high, shrill
voice, and when he sang out with all his strength
“Oh, Hal, where are you?” there was a general
feeling among them that the boy must have heard
it. Then they listened again.</p>

<p class='c009'>A reply was surely coming. It was not a single
word, but several that issued from the waterfall
this time. They seemed to come in the form of a
sentence, but only one was heard distinctly enough
to be recognized. That word was understood by
all. It was “behind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Behind what?” was the question that naturally
came to the minds of the listeners. But before
they could conjecture an answer, there came
a startling interruption that drove all thought of
the mystery of the cataract momentarily from
their minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>Happening to turn his face away from the waterfall,
the doctor beheld the dim outlines of a small
human figure twenty feet away. Believing it to
be Hal, he ran joyfully toward the boy and was
followed by the other men. The object of their
interest did not move. In a moment they were
close to him and holding their lanterns before
his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the boy was not Hal. It was Frank Bowler,
supposed to be back at Lakefarm and fast asleep
in the dormitory. And his countenance could
hardly have been whiter if it had been coated with
white enamel. Moreover, he was trembling as if
he had seen a ghost.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, Frank, what is the matter? What
does this mean?” cried Dr. Byrd; but he forgot
that he was too near the cataract to carry on a
conversation, and the boy did not understand him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then there came another scream out of the
roar of the waterfall, and Frank, the boastful, fell
on his knees, shaking with terror.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />HAL’S DISCOVERY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, what had become of Hal Kenyon?</p>

<p class='c009'>He had had a most remarkable adventure, and
connected with it was an equally remarkable discovery.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the search for the missing bag of specimens
Hal and Frank Bowler worked in adjoining
divisions of the territory that was being covered.
As they finished the search on their divisions they
met at the lower waterfall. They gazed a short
while into the tumbling water and then moved
down stream until they could hear each other’s
voices.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe we’ll find the bag,” were
Frank’s first words. “I don’t believe anybody’ll
ever find it. I bet it’s in the deep part o’ the river
where you couldn’t wade.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe it’s on the other side,” suggested Hal.
“There’s quite a little piece of ground over there
along the river bank. It’s pretty steep, but we
could walk on it if we’re careful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go over there and hunt,” Frank proposed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right. Come on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They continued on down the river to a wide
shallow stony place, and there took off their shoes
and waded over. Arrived on the opposite side,
they put on their shoes again, and as they were
doing this Hal said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’ll be getting dark before long and we don’t
want to have to walk along this steep place when
we can’t see plain. Let’s go up to the other end,
at the fall, and work down this way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” agreed Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they picked their way over stones and
through bushes and patches of stunted fir trees,
sometimes finding it necessary to hold onto a bush
or a rock in order to keep from slipping or losing
their balance and plunging into the river. But
they reached the cataract and then halted again to
look around them.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was little more than standing-room for
them at this point. This standing-room, however,
was level and comfortable. It was close to the fall,
which proved even more magnificent from this
side than from the other. The rocks were piled
high and wonderfully poised, and the water fell
from a lofty height and roared thunderously on the
rocky bed in the deep basin below.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both of the boys had a great desire to talk as
they gazed on the beauty of this scenery, but the
noise of the falls drowned out their voices. So
they had to content themselves with gazing and
pointing their fingers and nodding their heads
eagerly. As they stood there they made a new
and interesting discovery that caused them to forget
their purpose in crossing the river.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the near edge of the cataract the downpour
of water was extremely thin, so that the boys
could look behind. Hal’s notice was first to be
attracted to this peculiarity. Soon he was standing
as close to the fall as he could get with safety
and was gazing wonderingly into a cavernous
space beyond.</p>

<p class='c009'>Observing his attitude, Frank stepped near and
looked over his shoulder. Then Hal put his lips
close to his companion’s ear and shouted:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bad, there’s a cave back there!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank nodded understandingly, and Hal continued
in the same manner as before:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you see that thing on the floor of the cave?
It looks like a leather bag. Maybe it’s the one
we’re looking for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It can’t be,” Frank shouted in Hal’s ear.
“How would it get there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kenyon pointed to a huge projecting rock just
over their heads.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It might have struck that and glanced off
through the water,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal was now convinced that they had discovered
the object of their search. His first impulse was
to run back and inform Dr. Byrd, but a boyish
ambition made him hesitate, and that hesitation
was perhaps to be blamed for much of the trouble
that followed. As he lingered, this thought came
to him:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wouldn’t it be glorious if we could get behind
the waterfall, explore the cave, and come out and
report our double discovery to the owner of Lakefarm
and all the boys?” The idea was so tempting
that he was unable to give it up. The ledge behind
the fall was about nine feet from the edge of the
flat rocky precipice on which they stood. Now,
if he only had a plank nine or ten feet long, he
could easily bridge the chasm and walk through
the thin spray of water right into this wonderful
cave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Instinctively he looked about him for something
that would serve as a bridge, and what was his
astonishment to discover the very article he was
wishing for. Projecting from a thicket near by
was the end of a piece of lumber. He went over
and pulled and found it loose. It was a plank
twelve inches wide and ten feet long.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My!” was his exclamation, drowned by the
waterfall. “We’re not the first to find this place.
Somebody else is using that cave for something
and he’s had this plank here to cross over on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This certainly seemed to be the natural and only
logical explanation of the presence of the heavy
piece of lumber in the bushes. At least it would
serve the desired purpose, and Hal prepared to
thrust it across the chasm so that an end would
rest on each ledge of rock.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank understood quickly what his companion
had in mind and stood ready to help him. The
plank was heavy, but Hal was strong, and with a
well-calculated effort he placed it in position and
kept his balance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now you hold this end while I cross over,”
he screamed into Frank’s ear. “But don’t you
try to come over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank nodded eagerly. He had no intention of
obeying, but said nothing. He got down on his
knees and placed his hands on the plank. There
really was no need of this, but it was a natural
request for Hal to make, as he would feel safer
with a pair of hands steadying the unanchored
bridge.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was now dusk in the cañon and rapidly growing
dark. Probably this is one reason why the
doings of these two boys were not observed by any
of the other members of the searching company.
However, the view of most of them was shut off
by the high bluffs and rocks near the waterfall and
the rest were at a considerable distance away or
in hollows or depressions or beyond growths of
timber.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal stepped onto the plank and moved out over
the chasm toward the thin spray and the cave
beyond. Meanwhile Frank’s brain was working
rapidly. He was thinking of the glory that Hal
was winning and he was losing. Why should they
not share the glory alike? As soon as his companion
reached the cave he also would cross on
the plank, walk right through the roaring waterfall
and maybe carry back the coveted treasure
in his own hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, wouldn’t that be great!” he exclaimed
exultingly. “How the other kids’d look at me.
And if any of ’em got too fresh, I’d just clout ’em
on the jaw.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank actually executed the vicious swing of
“clouting” some youngster as he spoke. The
result was thrilling, but not what the youthful
terrorizer would have wished. He was half kneeling,
half sitting in an awkward and cramping position,
and as he swung his fist on an imaginary
jaw, he lost his balance, and his feet slipped from
under him.</p>

<p class='c009'>One heel struck the plank violently, and over it
tipped, then with a swing, slipped under the waterfall
and was shot down into the chasm. And Bad
almost went with it, but he caught himself at the
edge of the precipice. For a moment he lay there
and looked over. Then he remembered Hal. He
was gone. He must have followed the plank into
the whirling pool below.</p>

<p class='c009'>In an ague of horror he crawled back a few
yards and staggered to his feet; then with one
terrified look behind him, he started on a wild
run along the steep shore, sobbing hysterically as
he ran:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my! Oh, my! I’ve killed Hal! I’ve
killed Hal! Oh, what will I do? What will I do?
I’ll be hung, I know!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He arrived at the place where they had crossed
and dropped down and pulled off his shoes and
stockings. As he was thus occupied he continued
his fearful forebodings:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pepper said some of us bad boys’d end on the
gallows, and I know he meant me. He could look
right through me. I always felt it. He’s the
first one to call me ‘Bad,’ and then the kids did.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know I’ll be hung if—no, I won’t
either. Nobody saw us. I won’t tell. I’ll keep
it to myself, and nobody’ll ever find out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He crossed back to the other side and in the dusk
saw the boys gathering a few hundred feet away.
Mr. Porter had called them a few minutes before
with a whistle blast, but Frank had not heard it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still resolved to guard his terrible secret, Frank
hastened to join the other Scouts. Fortunately
it was now almost dark and none of them could
see his face plainly, or they would have noticed
how pale he was. As a rule he was talkative,
but now he did not speak at all, except to give
the shortest possible answers when addressed.
One or two of the boys, observing his unusual
manner, asked him what was the matter and he
made no reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the way back to the school he walked by himself,
lagging a little behind much of the time, as
if tired, in order that he might not be forced to talk.
He was afraid to talk. It was all he could do to
keep from crying.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time they reached the school he had lost
his nerve and decided that he must tell somebody
all about it. He could not bear to keep the secret
any longer. But no suitable opportunity offered
itself to speak to the doctor or Mr. Frankland.
He might have taken one of the boys aside and
told his story to him, but Frank could not remember
one of his schoolmates whom he had not threatened
to “clean up” or “clout in the jaw” at one
time or another. Even Bun his brother, whom
he had threatened with a “paste on the blinker”
only the day before, might censure him and tell
him he ought to be hanged or be sent to jail.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Frank did not tell his story when his
strongest impulse to sob it out possessed him. He went
with the rest of the boys into the wash room and
then into the dining room and ate his supper in
silence. His face was not so pale now, but his
peculiar manner was observed by several. However,
it was thought that he was dejected, as were
many others, over the fate of Hal Kenyon, and
nobody embarrassed him with questions.</p>

<p class='c009'>After supper the boys were sent off to bed. Mr.
Frankland and Mr. Porter usually had charge of
this “good night” watch and slept in the dormitory,
but on this occasion Mrs. Byrd and the
matronly cook superintended affairs. Once or
twice Frank almost yielded to an impulse to confide
in the doctor’s wife, but his general dislike for
both girls and women held him back.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank and Byron slept together. Dr. Byrd
had not spared his money in constructing the buildings
of this mountain school, and for every two
boys there was a separate room, neatly and comfortably
fitted.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were all outside rooms, with a window for
each, all on the first floor, so that it would be easy
for the boys to escape in case of fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Byron was tired and could hardly keep his eyes
open until he got into bed. He was so tired that
he hardly noticed the unusual silence of his
brother; or if he did, he attributed it to the same
cause that made him sleepy. As for Frank, he
never was more wide awake and had no idea of
sleeping. He sat down on a chair and began to
undress slowly, but there was a reason in his slowness.
He was watching Bun constantly out of the
corner of his eye and his nervousness was greatly
relieved when he saw his brother fall into bed and
to sleep almost instantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Frank stopped undressing and sat quietly
for a few minutes watching the boy in bed. Soon
the latter’s heavy breathing announced that he was
fast asleep, and the young watcher drew on his
trousers again. He worked rapidly now, drawing
on his stockings and shoes, and putting on his coat
and hat. Then he moved toward the window,
which was open in accordance with the health
ideas of Dr. Byrd.</p>

<p class='c009'>With another hasty glance at his slumbering
brother, Frank put both legs over the window sill
and dropped to the ground, a distance of only a
few feet. Then, like a flash, he straightened up
and ran over the lawn toward the road.</p>

<p class='c009'>The moon was shining and the boy concealed
his flight as much as possible by keeping under a
row of balsam poplars along the east edge of the
campus. After leaving the shadow of these, he
found it necessary to break into the open, and he
ran down the road toward the river with all his
speed.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a wild-looking figure that raced along the
trail toward Mummy Cañon that night. Half a
mile from the school a small animal shot out from
a clump of junipers and darted across his path
just behind him. Believing it to be a wildcat, he
doubled his speed, too much frightened to think
of stopping, although his hat was whiffed off by
the wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>His hair was rather long and it was blown in
disorder. Like a scary horse he shied at every
large rock, dark hollow, or ghost-like stunted
spruce or fir.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up hill and down he ran, through ravine and
along the precipice of a hollow known as “Baby
Gorge.” Colorado nights are cool, even in the
summer, and he did not become overheated. A
few times he was forced to stop and walk for want
of breath, but as soon as he recovered, on he went
at the best speed he could make. He was a sturdy
youngster and stood the test.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last he reached Flathead Pass and hastened
through, over a ledge of rock along the bank of
the river. Another quarter of a mile, and he was
able to see the lights of the lanterns of the hunters
for the lost boy. On he ran, and as he neared the
party ahead, he realized tremblingly that they
were near the fatal waterfall. Now he began to
wonder what he should do. He had had no plan
in mind when he started out; all he could say to
himself was that he must be present and watch
the search. He did not intend to reveal himself,
but wanted to be near when the body of Hal was
taken out of the water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank approached as near to the men by the
waterfall as he thought safe. He stopped behind
a clump of bushes and peered around to watch
proceedings. Presently the doctor and his companions
moved away from the cataract and
stopped within a few feet of the bushes, and there
the boy heard their excited discussion regarding
the cries that seemed to issue from the falling
water. Then he saw them cut a club for each and
advance again toward the place of mystery.</p>

<p class='c009'>The watching boy was intensely thrilled by
what he had heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suggestion that possibly the screams were
those of a panther or a lynx added a new element
of fear to the situation. But as he heard the
strange sound repeated again and again, he dismissed
all thought of a wild animal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Hal’s ghost, I know; it can’t be anything
else,” he chattered; and without knowing why, he
left his place of concealment and started toward
the waterfall. A dozen paces from the men he
stopped, fearful of announcing his presence, yet
half hoping he would be discovered. Just then
Dr. Byrd turned and saw him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c010'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />HAL A PRISONER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, he’s dead! Hal’s dead, and that’s his
ghost screaming!” moaned Frank Bowler as he
writhed in mental agony at the feet of Dr. Byrd.</p>

<p class='c009'>The latter stooped and lifted the boy gently to
his feet. Then he took him by the hand and led
him down stream beyond the noise of the waterfall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense, Frank. If that’s his voice, he’s
alive and very lusty, and we’re going to get him
out as soon as we find out where he is. But what
does all this mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, that’s his ghost; I know it is,” insisted
the boy still wildly. “Don’t let them hang me,
Dr. Byrd! Don’t let them hang me! I won’t do
it any more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t do what any more?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Threaten to clout anybody on the jaw,”
sobbed Frank, who now for the first time that
evening found it possible to shed tears, and they
came in a flood. But at last he found his voice
between sobs and continued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I kicked the plank and he fell down in the
waterfall. He’s drownded; I know it. I saw him
fall. Please, doctor, don’t let ’em hang me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get that out of your mind, my boy,” reassured
Dr. Byrd. “Nobody’s going to hang you, whatever
you did. They don’t hang boys of your age.
But I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This reassurance that he was not in danger of
the gallows gave the boy better control of himself
and he was able to tell his story less hysterically.
Through a series of pointed questions the doctor
finally drew from him all the details regarding the
discovery of the cave behind the cataract and
Hal’s attempt to get into it, and then he announced:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, the mystery is explained at last. Don’t
worry, Frank. Hal isn’t drowned. He’s safe
behind the waterfall and we’ll get him out as soon
as we can.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I saw him fall,” insisted the boy, his eyes
staring wide with wonder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No you didn’t,” replied the doctor. “It was
your imagination that caused you to think you saw
him fall. He was probably on the ledge beyond
the cataract and staggered as he stepped from the
plank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was the true explanation, and takes us back
to Hal when he was entrapped. He saw what his
companion had done and attempted to reassure
him that no serious damage, beyond the loss of
the plank, had resulted; but Frank darted away in
terror almost instantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal watched the fleeing boy with puzzled amusement
at first. He could not understand why he
should have run away so hurriedly. He did not
know that Frank believed he had killed his friend,
but supposed the impetuous lad was hastening
away for assistance. However, it seemed strange
that he should not have tried to tell Hal his intentions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having no fear as to the outcome of his adventure,
Hal began to look about him. But the cave
was dark, except close to the roaring water, and
he was able to see but little. He was afraid to
venture far back lest he step into a pit or over an
underground precipice. So he decided to wait
where he was until help arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently his eyes fell again on the supposed
bag of souvenirs, and he stooped over and picked
it up. Yes, there was no mistake about it; the
object was a bag of soft leather and contained half
a peck, seemingly of small stones or quartz. The
string, run through a dozen eyes near the opening,
was tied, and as it was too dark to see, he did not
open it. Help would come to him in a few minutes
and he would turn the bag over to Dr. Byrd for
further inspection.</p>

<p class='c009'>But help did not come in a few minutes. Half
an hour passed and Hal began to wonder a little.
He had reasoned out an explanation of Frank’s
sudden departure, so that had ceased to puzzle
him. Frank was very impetuous, and undoubtedly
had realized at once that it would be useless,
on account of the noise of the waterfall, to attempt
to talk with the prisoner, so he must have decided
instantly that the only thing for him to do was to
run for assistance before it became too dark.</p>

<p class='c009'>But as the shades of the cañon grew heavy and
no rescuers appeared, Hal became uneasy. Probably
an hour had elapsed since he was trapped in
this place, and he was becoming alarmed. What
could have happened to Frank? Had he fallen
into the river and—no, that could not be. Hal
had watched him until he passed the deep part
and sat down near the fording place to pull off
his shoes and stockings. Frank had crossed the
river, no doubt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another half hour elapsed and the prisoner was
ready to give up hope for the night. Something
had happened to prevent Frank from carrying the
news to Mr. Porter, or else it was deemed too dark
to attempt a rescue at once. The west shore was
pretty steep and a single misstep in the dark
might plunge one into the water or onto the rocks,
ten, fifteen or twenty feet below. Possibly some
one had been sent back to the school for lanterns.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several times he wished he had some matches
in order that he might explore the cave and
examine the contents of the leather bag, but Dr.
Byrd never permitted his boys to carry any. The
buildings of the school were lighted by a small
electric plant connected with the shops, and they
were heated with steam pipes and radiators, so
that there was little call for the use of matches on
the part of anybody at the school. Moreover, the
doctor had absolutely forbidden the use of cigarettes
at Lakefarm, and matches are very necessary
to the habit.</p>

<p class='c009'>The waterfall was almost as effective as a stone
wall would have been in shutting from view the
light of the moon in the cañon. However, from
the point where he had crossed over on the plank
he could look out and see dimly the shadowy contour
of the mountain. Then, gazing upward at an
angle, he could see a few stars shining dimly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal spent some time gazing out through this
opening. At first he looked for the approach of
rescuers, but as time grew into more than an hour
and nobody appeared, he continued to gaze
because it was more pleasant to do so than to rest
his eyes on the darkness of the cave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once only he yielded to an impulse to make an
exploration of his prison. This he did because
he had become extremely tired of standing in one
position so long. Indeed, he was almost ready
to pitch over into the falling water when he finally
dropped to his hands and knees and began to feel
about him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The floor of the cave was fairly smooth, but so
damp that his trousers and underclothing became
wet to the skin at the knees in a short time. This,
however, did not bother him, and he continued his
exploration for several feet back.</p>

<p class='c009'>Satisfied with this he arose to his feet and went
through a few simple calisthenic exercises that he
had learned at Lakefarm. This warmed him up
and he returned to the edge of the cave. He would
have been glad to lie down and sleep until morning,
but the uncomfortable dampness of the floor and
the fear of catching a bad cold caused him to remain
erect.</p>

<p class='c009'>How much longer he continued to stand and
look out, principally at a handful of stars, he did
not know. It was a monotonous occupation, and
he found it wise to stand back several feet for fear
lest, in a moment of dizziness or drowsiness, he
lose his balance and pitch forward and down with
the falling water. Suddenly, however, he became
very wide awake and attentive, for several lights
were approaching some distance down stream on
the right shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>Apparently they were lanterns. At once Hal
surmised correctly who carried them and was certain
that they were coming to his rescue. Probably
Frank was with them, he further reasoned.</p>

<p class='c009'>But when he saw the lights separate, two coming
upstream and two going down, he was puzzled.
What could this mean? Why did they not ford
the river at once and come up on the other side?
Here was the only place to help him out of his
prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>He could see the lights of Dr. Byrd and Mr. Porter
until they approached close to the cataract,
when the falling water shut off his view of them.
They remained out of his sight, however, for presently
they walked down stream again, stopping
near the rapids. The light of their lanterns made
their forms fairly distinct.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Hal saw the other two men from down
stream rejoin them. He looked closely for a fifth
member of the party, a boy, but was disappointed.
As he observed the four now engaged in a seemingly
puzzled discussion, the waterfall prisoner
decided that it was time for him to do something
to attract attention. Was it possible that they
did not know where he was? The idea seemed
ridiculous; and yet what other explanation of their
manner and actions could be given?</p>

<p class='c009'>So he let out a lusty scream, and then watched
for its effect. Apparently it had none, so he gave
another and another. The men continued their
discussion, paying no attention to his cries. Hal
guessed that the sound of his voice was drowned in
the noise of the waterfall. This conclusion threw
him into despair. All sorts of direful forebodings
now crowded his brain. Maybe Frank was
drowned after all, and the searching party was
looking for both of them. If this was true, they
would drag Frank’s body from the river, while
he, Hal, would be left to starve to death behind the
cataract because he was unable to make his presence
known.</p>

<p class='c009'>This fear set him almost wild, and he continued
to utter scream after scream, until his throat
became so irritated that he had to quit. Then he
caught some of the falling water in his hand and
drank it and his throat felt more comfortable.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile the entire search party came upstream
again and disappeared, remaining out of
Hal’s sight a long time. During the entire hour
and a half that they spent in the timber, the boy
kept up a succession of screams and cries for help.
Naturally the uncertainty of the situation had a
depressing effect on him, but he set his teeth and
would not give up. Daylight surely would bring
hope. But daylight was many hours off.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally Dr. Byrd and his companions returned
within Hal’s range of vision. He saw the lights
and the men move down the river, and watched
them as they raked the bed of the stream along
the shore, but could not make out what they were
doing. He continued his cries for help; he pitched
his voice in every possible key, instinctively realizing
that certain keys were more readily drowned
in the roar of the waterfall than others. Then
followed the puzzled discussion over these cries,
and it was not long before the boy knew that he
had attracted attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>He saw them approach the cataract again, then
go back, engage in another discussion, cut some
clubs in a thicket, and return once more to the
waterfall. They passed beyond his vision, as on
former occasions, and before long he caught Mr.
Porter’s shrill “Oh, Hal, where are you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Behind the waterfall,” replied the boy in his
highest pitch. But he put most stress on the first
word, which was the only one caught distinctly by
the rescuers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Hal witnessed the discovery of Frank,
who was standing just within his range of vision.
As the light of the lanterns was thrown on that
frightened youth’s face, Hal saw him fall down
before the doctor, who picked him up and led
him down stream, while the others followed.</p>

<p class='c009'>From this moment he watched proceedings with
new sensations of wonder. He could see that
Frank seemed to be telling something to the men.
But they did not listen long to his story. They
seemed suddenly to decide on a course of action;
they walked farther down the stream to the fording
place where two of them pulled off their shoes
and waded across, still carrying the lanterns. One
of them also took with him one of the rakes, which
Hal supposed to be merely a long pole.</p>

<p class='c009'>They reached the western bank and climbed up
on the steep shore. Then they picked their way
carefully toward the cataract. Hal was certain
now he was about to be rescued. His cries for
help were no longer needed, and he waited in
silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two men’s progress along the difficult shore
was slow, but finally they reached the flat rock
close to the waterfall. By this time Hal could
distinguish the features of the two men in the light
of their lanterns and also observed that the
“pole” carried by Pepper was a rake. The man
with Pepper was Dr. Byrd.</p>

<p class='c009'>On reaching the rock, the janitor-chauffeur
hooked his lantern onto the rake and extended it
toward the fall. Finding the thin section of the
cataract, he thrust it through and Hal seized both
lantern and rake eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Disengaging the light from the garden implement,
Hal was about to pass the latter back when
he caught sight of a piece of paper tied to it. He
set the lantern down, broke the string around the
paper, and spread out the latter close to the lantern,
taking care lest he tear the wet note-book
leaf. Then he read the following:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Frankland and Mr. Porter have gone back
in the automobile for some planks to make a
bridge. Can you make yourself comfortable in
there until morning? Answer.</p>

<div class='c013'>Dr. Byrd.”</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c010'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />THE MYSTERY OF THE LEATHER BAG</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>After reading the doctor’s note, Hal picked up
the lantern and swung it around so as to get a
wider view of the cave. He was able to see the
wall at the other edge of the cataract, but was not
sure of the depth of the cavern.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he set the lantern down again and searched
his pockets until he found a piece of white paper
and a pencil. For a few moments he cast about
him for a hard, smooth surface on which to lay the
paper, but the best he could find was the plain
flat handle of his pocketknife. With this on his
knee and bending close to the light of the lantern,
Hal laboriously inscribed the following:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m all right till morning. I’m going to
explore the cave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He tied this note to the rake and reached it back
to Pepper. Then he waited for the answer he saw
the doctor preparing. It came presently and was
as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be careful and don’t fall into another trap.
We’re going back to the other side. Maybe we’ll
try to get you before morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal saw the two men depart and then turned his
attention to the dark depths of the cavern.</p>

<p class='c009'>The floor was smooth, though irregular. The
mouth opening upon the waterfall was about ten
feet wide, but the passage narrowed somewhat
further in. Here it made a sharp turn to the
right, and Hal followed the passage a hundred
feet, when he was stopped by a wall of earth and
rocks. There was no further exploration to make,
for this was the end of the cave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal flashed his lantern all around and above,
but could find nothing more of particular interest,
except the general formation of the cave. He was
not certain that he could see the ceiling. At one
place particularly there seemed to be a black void
above.</p>

<p class='c009'>The right wall of this part of the cave slanted
upward like the side of a steep hill. Moreover,
this side was jagged and irregular, so that Hal
was certain he could climb up some distance. The
other side hung over like a huge cliff, slanting at
the same angle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This looks like a big crevice in the rocks,”
mused the boy as he gazed up and around him.
“I wish some more of the boys were here with
lanterns. I’d like to hunt till I found something
worth coming here for. It looks like a shame to
have such an adventure as this and find nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes,” he suddenly remembered; “there’s
the bag of souvenirs. I haven’t examined them
yet. I’ll go back and see what they are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So he turned to the mouth of the cave and set
the lantern down on the floor, while he stooped
over and untied the string around the opening of
the leather bag. Pulling it apart, Hal was soon
fingering a curious collection of many sorts of
stones and quartz, some of which shone brilliantly
in the light of the lantern.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My! they look as if they might be worth a
fortune,” exclaimed the boy as he picked up one
after another and examined them eagerly, “for
Mr. Miles said he wouldn’t take a thousand dollars
for them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he had nothing else to do, Hal continued to
examine the curios for some time, becoming more
and more impressed with their novelty. Some of
them evidently had been altered in shape by the
hand of man, particularly a few that looked like
Indian amulets, and Hal was convinced that the
collector had visited some deserted pueblos or cliff
houses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dr. Byrd said Mr. Miles had spent some time
in the mountains,” he mused: “and I bet he can
tell some interesting stories of the places he’s
been in. When he gets well enough to be around,
I’m going to ask him to tell us all about his adventures.
He must have had some with that airship
in the mountains.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal’s meditations and his interest in the contents
of the leather bag were interrupted finally by
the reappearance of lights approaching along the
river bank. He drew the string tight around the
receptacle and tied it. Then he awaited the
approach of his rescuers.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they came near, he saw that they were bearing
two wide planks, one man at either end of each,
the leaders carrying the lanterns. Evidently they
had decided not to wait until morning before
attempting to release the boy from his strange
prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally they reached the flat rock near the waterfall
and the two planks were laid across the intervening
space between the shore and the cave. Hal
adjusted his end of the planks so that they rested
firmly; then he picked up the leather bag and his
lantern and walked across the bridge.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without further delay, they turned and walked
down the stream again. No attempt was made to
discuss the affair until they had forded the river
and returned to the stage road near which the
automobile had been left. Hal was then the first
to speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s Frank?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We took him back to the school and put him
in bed,” replied Mr. Frankland. “Evidently you
could see and recognize him from behind the waterfall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” answered the boy. Then he continued:
“It wasn’t his fault that I was trapped behind the
fall. It was all an accident. He slipped and hit
the board with his foot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal’s companions were amused at this unconscious
charity toward Frank. If there had been
light enough they probably would have winked at
each other. In his fear of the gallows, the former
youthful terrorizer had confessed just how he happened
to kick the plank into the waterfall and, as
he thought, dropped Hal to a fearful fate.</p>

<p class='c009'>With little delay, except to crank the machine,
they all got into the automobile and soon were
bowling along the stage road. As they were leaving
the cañon, Dr. Byrd inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What kind of place is that cave, Hal?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy gave a brief description of it; then he
added:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a dandy. It isn’t so awfully big, but it’s
big enough; and it’s so different from most
caves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You didn’t find any rubies or garnets or
streaks of gold there, did you?” inquired Mr.
Frankland, nudging the boy, who sat beside him
in the back seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but there might be something of the kind.
I wish we could go back with lots of lanterns and
examine the place carefully.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think we’ll forget all about that cave for a
while at least,” announced the doctor with an air
of decision. “It came near proving a fatal discovery,
and I feel like waiting until I’ve had time
to get over this scare.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal had offered his suggestion rather doubtfully,
for he felt that a scolding was due him and
Frank for their boldness in crossing the river and
continuing their search along the steep shore on
the west side. However, the adventure had
proved successful, for the lost bag of specimens
had been found; so the boy did not feel nearly so
much like a culprit as he would have felt in the
face of failure.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the doctor said nothing more that might
sound like criticism. He was too thankful for the
discovery and rescue of the lost boy for that.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently the talk was changed to the bag of
specimens. Naturally much wonder was felt
because of the place where it had been found. Hal
explained his theory that in falling from the aeroplane
it had struck a slanting projection of rock
and bounded into the cave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course that’s barely possible,” said Dr.
Byrd; “but it’s hardly probable. I can’t get
away from the belief that the bag did not break
loose in the air.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You think it fell to the ground with the aeroplane?”
Hal inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. Why not? I can’t conceive what force
could have broken or pulled it loose before the
machine hit the ground. Did it just happen to
come untied from the strut at that time? Barely
possible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did it get into the cave then?” asked Mr.
Porter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somebody put it there if it didn’t fall there,”
volunteered Pepper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course,” said the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somebody <em>might</em> have put it in the cave,”
agreed Hal reflectively. “We weren’t the first
ones to discover the place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you know?” inquired Dr. Byrd
quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By the plank we found in the bushes. It was
there for a bridge, that was plain. Somebody’s
been using the cave for something.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Exclamations of surprise greeted this information.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you find anything in the cave that tended
to prove your suspicion?” asked Mr. Frankland.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing except the leather bag.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal hoped that his suggestions would arouse the
interest of Dr. Byrd to such an extent that he
would decide upon further investigation, but he
was disappointed. If the owner of Lakefarm felt
any such desire, he failed to express it.</p>

<p class='c009'>On their arrival at the school, the automobile
was run into the garage, and then a general move
was made for their bedrooms. While the doctor
explained matters to his wife, Hal and the two
instructors had gone to bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The noise Hal made in entering the dormitory
and walking along the hall awakened Bun Bowler,
who was sleeping with his brother Frank. Eagerly
Bun slipped out of bed and peeped through the
slightly opened doorway.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, they’ve brought Hal back,” he said to
himself. “I wonder where they found him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Had it been Frank he would have yelled out a
congratulation, in spite of the lateness of the hour
and the rule requiring quiet in the dormitory, but
Byron crept quietly back into the bed. As he
crawled over his brother—Frank always insisted
on sleeping in front—the latter gave a start and a
jerk and cried in a voice of terror:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t do it any more! I won’t do it any
more! I won’t threaten to clout anybody in the
jaw—never, never again!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c010'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />CONVINCING BAD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The next day was one of rejoicing among the
Boy Scouts of Lakefarm. If there had been any
doubt concerning the popularity of Hal Kenyon,
that doubt surely was gone now. The fact that
his parents were poor made no difference with
any of his schoolmates. Indeed, Dr. Byrd would
not have permitted any feeling against Hal on
this account. There would have been trouble instantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The news of Hal’s return spread rapidly soon
after sun-up. It was communicated principally
in the wash room, accompanied by a wild rumor
of the manner in which he had been entrapped.
Some one started a story that Hal had been a
prisoner in a robbers’ cave and was rescued only
with much daring and danger. Frank’s connection
with the real adventure remained in darkness.
Nobody, except Hal, Dr. Byrd, Mrs. Byrd,
the two instructors, Pepper, and Frank himself,
knew anything about it, and there had been a
general agreement that it was wisest to keep the
matter secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal and Frank both slept late that morning.
The doctor gave orders that they should not be
awakened until they had “had their sleep out.”
While the others were eating breakfast, Mr.
Frankland went to Frank’s room and found the
latter dressing. The boy’s eyes were red and
swollen from weeping. He searched the face of
the instructor carefully, and then inquired, with
trembling voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you find him, Mr. Frankland?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly,” replied the latter reassuringly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And did you get him out?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You bet we did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Alive?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Alive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And is he here—alive?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He surely is,” declared Mr. Frankland, the
smile on his face broadening.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was so overcome with relief that for
several minutes he was unable to continue his
dressing. A stocking that he had been in the act
of putting on dropped to the floor, and it seemed
that he could not reach down and pick it up again.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had been ready for this announcement, and
yet it was hard for him to believe that it was true.
He could not get rid of that picture of Hal falling
with the water onto the rocks at the foot of
the cataract. It was so real that only the sight
of his friend standing before him would convince
him that his eyes had not fooled him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, Frank; hurry up and get dressed, and
I’ll take you to Hal and show him to you,” urged
Mr. Frankland, still with a smile of amusement.</p>

<p class='c009'>This promise renewed Frank’s energy, and he
picked up the stocking and pulled it on. Then he
slipped on his shoes and announced that he was
ready to call on his rescued schoolmate.</p>

<p class='c009'>They stepped out into the hall and walked several
doors toward the farther end. Hal’s door
was slightly ajar, and Mr. Frankland pushed it
wide open and they walked in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal was still asleep. Frank stepped forward,
like one in a trance, and placed one hand on the
face of the sleeper. Suddenly Hal’s eyes opened
wide and he sat up in bed. He recalled everything
immediately, as his first words indicated:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello, Bad; I’m all right. Why, what’s the
matter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>And no wonder! Frank had fallen forward on
the bed and buried his face in the counterpane.
The relief of the truth was too much for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Frankland had not realized the tenseness
of the nervous strain under which the boy was
laboring, or he would have proceeded more carefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, what <em>is</em> the matter?” repeated Hal,
himself half alarmed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other boy sobbed on for a minute or two,
and Hal threw off the bed clothes and sat on the
edge of the bed. Then he shifted his gaze from
Frank to the instructor and back to the boy again.</p>

<p class='c009'>But finally Frank got sufficient control of himself
to choke down his sobs, and he arose and
wiped his eyes with his fists and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I——I thought sure you was dead, Hal.
How—in the world did you get out?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Out o’ where—the cave?” inquired the older
boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, out o’ the water.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Out o’ the water? I wasn’t in the water.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You wasn’t?” Frank’s eyes opened very wide
again. He had been assured of this before, but it
was as incredible from Hal. Still with a
wondering look in his eyes and disbelief in his voice, he
continued, putting one hand on his friend’s left
arm:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hal, I saw you fall. You went down, down.
I saw you, oh, I did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The other laughed outright. The laugh was so
merry and hearty that presently Frank wasn’t so
sure of what he had seen as he thought he had
been. Then Hal gave his delusion a further jar
by saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“No you didn’t do any such thing, Frank. I
didn’t fall at all. Is that what made you run
away so fast? It was getting dark, you know, and
maybe there was a shadow in the water that looked
like me falling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That must have been it,” declared Frank with
a big sigh of relief. Then he laughed hysterically,
for the picture in his memory had changed.
Instead of a falling boy, he saw a shadow, or a
dark-colored patch of water, in the tumbling
flood.</p>

<p class='c009'>That settled it. Frank recovered his nerve, but
he was a much quieter boy for several days after.
He was fourteen years old, his voice had already
“changed,” and he was begging permission from
his parents to wear long trousers on “dress”
occasions; hence, it was no wonder that such an
experience as he had recently gone through should
convince him that it was about time for him to
mend his ways.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lakefarm was a comparatively tame place for
several days following the happenings in Mummy
Cañon. After the affair had been thoroughly discussed
by the boys and nothing more of interest
could be found, the subject was laid aside and
picked up only now and then. The bag of specimens
was returned to its owner and little more was
heard concerning that for some time. But the
aviator, Mr. Miles, continued to be of interest, for
the boys looked eagerly forward to the time when
his broken bones would be sufficiently mended to
enable him to be among them and tell them stories
of his adventures.</p>

<p class='c009'>The summer program in the school was more of
a vacation series of doings than anything else.
Some book work and shop duties were required
each week, but these were really a relief from the
long succession of outings and excursions that
filled the greater part of the summer program.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the favorite sports at the school were
baseball and swimming. The campus and the lake
were therefore scenes of much activity in the
warmer months. All things considered, it was a
lively time the boys at Lakefarm school had the
year round.</p>

<p class='c009'>Because of these activities, the young Scouts
looked forward with little interest toward vacation-time.
Most of them spent the Christmas holidays
at home, but few remained away from the
school during the whole summer season. At the
time of the beginning of these events, the vacation
weeks were more than half gone, and the absentees
were fast returning. A special program, including
an excursion to the Grand Cañon of the Colorado
River, was scheduled for the latter part of August
and the early part of September, and most of
the Scouts were expected to be present for this.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys of Lakefarm were skilled in mountain
climbing. It was their experience in this line that
emboldened Hal and Frank to hunt along the steep
bank of Flathead River for the lost bag of specimens.
However, Dr. Byrd’s policy on all mountain-climbing
excursions was to avoid steep and
dangerous places, and he felt that he had good
reason to scold them for taking such a chance.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the day following the imprisonment of Hal
in the waterfall cave, the doctor summoned all the
boys into the assembly room and lectured them.
He told them he had thought his instructions from
time to time in mountain climbing had impressed
upon them sufficiently the importance of judgment
in their excursions among the hills. Finally he
wound up by saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems that some of you boys need another
lesson on this subject. So our next outing will
be a mountain climb. We’ll have to give you some
more advice as to where to go and what places to
avoid. As soon as the other boys get back we
will go over and climb Porcupine Hill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And see Aunt Sarah Jane,” whispered Pickles
to Ferdinand loudly enough to be heard by
all in the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Byrd smiled. He expected some such eager
demonstration. Aunt Sarah Jane Turman was
an aged woman who lived with her husband on
the very peak of the mountain. Porcupine Hill
was one of the lower mountains of the neighborhood,
being just west of Flathead and affording
the best view of the top of the latter. Aunt Sarah
was an interesting character, a kind-hearted
nurse, ever thoughtful of the welfare of her
friends and acquaintances. Most of the boys had
been up there several times and every one of them
adopted Mrs. Turman as his aunt on beholding
her pleasant face and hearing her cheery voice
and eating some of her “dandy” bread covered
with a liberal supply of homemade jam.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the doctor’s lecture closed with anything
but an unpleasant announcement, the fulfillment
of which was to prove of considerable importance
in the chain of events that made notable that summer
at Lakefarm, Mummy Cañon and Flathead
Mountain.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />AIRSHIP PLANS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The climb up Porcupine Hill was not made as
soon as most of the boys had hoped. Several
weeks elapsed and the program that had been
mapped out by the doctor was too full for any additions.
Meanwhile all the absent boys of the
school returned, and the trip to Grand Cañon was
taken.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only one-fourth of the boys took this trip this
year, it always being reserved for the fourth-year,
or senior, pupils. Hal Kenyon was one of
the eleven boys who visited these wonders of the
Colorado River on this occasion. And on his return
he was so full of the delights of the scenery
that Mummy Cañon and Flathead were for a
time of minor interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>But in time their old fascination returned. The
cave behind the waterfall at no time ceased to
be an object of much interest to him, and he was
continually wishing that something would put it
into Dr. Byrd’s head to make a thorough
inspection of the cavern. And if this were done, Hal
naturally hoped that he would be one of the inspectors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile the broken bones of Aviator Miles
mended rapidly. As soon as it was deemed safe,
he was permitted to leave his bed and hobble
around on crutches, his leg still in a cast, however.
From the time of his first exit from the
Hospital, he was an object of much interest to
the boys. They gathered around him at every
opportunity and begged for stories of his experiences,
and he usually had something of absorbing
interest to tell.</p>

<p class='c009'>He told them that he had been among the
Rockies from Yellowstone National Park to the
Grand Cañon for two months before his accident,
and he exhibited before their eager eyes his
collection of stones and quartz that Hal had discovered
in the waterfall cave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But they’re not all here,” he remarked as he
poured them out on a newspaper that he had
spread on the lawn in front of Dr. Byrd’s home.
He was seated on the grass while a score of boys
stood around in eager attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are the others?” inquired Fes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know,” replied the aviator slowly.
“There were six pretty fair sized gold nuggets
in the bag when I fell; or they were there a few
hours before, and I don’t see how they could have
disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t see any when I opened the bag in the
cave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal volunteered this information, but the sentence
was finished with a different tone of voice
from the tone at the beginning. In the midst of
his statement he suddenly realized the importance
to him of the disappearance of the nuggets, and
a lump arose in his throat, so that he could hardly
finish what he started to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everybody noticed the change in Kenyon’s
voice, and all looked at him as if for an explanation.
Conscious of his seeming self-betrayal and
of the inquiring glances directed at him, he
blushed with confusion. The aviator suspected
at once that these were signs of guilt.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Hal knew better and flashed back a look
of scorn and indignation at his silent accusers.
Recovering his natural tone, he said in a cool,
measured voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know what became of those nuggets.
They certainly were not in the bag when I opened
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Most of the boys believed in Hal and were convinced
by this sturdy statement. Mr. Miles, however,
was not convinced, although he did not like
to hold any suspicion against a boy who had impressed
him so well. But he saw nothing to be
gained by embarrassing Kenyon at present.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” he said; “this isn’t the only mystery
connected with the affair. I’m just as curious
to know how the bag ever got into that cave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You think somebody put it there?” Hal inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Being an invalid and unable to get around
very conveniently, I haven’t been able to inspect
the place yet. But from all descriptions received,
I’m in need of more evidence to convince me that
it bounced in there by accident. In the first place,
I’m dead certain it fell to the ground with the
aeroplane.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe the strut it was tied to was what broke
and made you fall,” suggested Hal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wasn’t a strut at all that broke. It was a
couple of stay wires. The struts couldn’t break
under any but the most extraordinary circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you goin’ to fix up your aeroplane again,
or get a new one?” asked Hugh Messinger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, nothing can be done with that pile of junk.
You boys might as well burn the wood and tote
the steel framework into your blacksmith shop.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you going to quit flying?” asked Byron
Bowler.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Miles looked with keen amusement at the
last questioner and replied with a wink:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do I look like a quitter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He surely didn’t, although forced to stop for
several weeks with some broken bones. Miles was
a sturdy, determined-looking man, with firm-set
jaw and clear bright eye that gave no hint of hesitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What you going to do? Buy another airship?”
Byron persisted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve bought one already.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have!” eagerly exclaimed several of
the boys. “Where is it?” one of them continued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s on its way out here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Out here!”</p>

<p class='c009'>This exclamation also came in chorus from half
a dozen astonished Boy Scouts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” answered the crippled aviator; “it’s
on its way out here. But it isn’t put together
ready to fly. It’s in the knock-down. I’m going
to give you boys the job of putting it together.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!—when will it be here?” asked one enthusiastic
youngster.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a week. Dr. Byrd and I had several talks
about the matter, and he’s decided to let you boys
have the job. I won’t be strong enough to do
much on it myself, but I’ll be on hand and boss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What kind is it going to be?” asked Pickles.
“Like the one you fell in?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not exactly. It’ll be a biplane, but a much
better one than the Ozone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the Ozone?” inquired Ferdinand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the name of the biplane I fell in. The
new one will carry two passengers besides the
operator.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, ain’t that fine!” cried Glen Juza. “It’s
just swell. And can we all have a ride?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh-ho,” laughed Miles. “I thought it would
come to that. But it really isn’t up to me to
decide. I might say yes, and Dr. Byrd might say
no. He probably would.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Disappointed looks and expressions followed
this prophecy. The doctor’s pupils could just as
well have predicted such an outlook without the
assistance of older heads, but they were naturally
optimistic.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But don’t be discouraged, boys,” added the
aviator. “Your time will come sooner or later.
Maybe you’ll be afraid to go up with me when you
see the airship all finished. It—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes we will!” “I wouldn’t!” “You don’t
know me!” were some of the brave interruptions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It won’t look very safe,” was the aviator’s
warning. “Pretty thin and flimsy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t care; I’ll go up in anything you will,”
cried Frank Bowler, who had listened to the conversation
in silence up to this time. He was
gradually regaining his former nerve and bluster,
but his voice did not yet have a natural ring.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What will the new aeroplane look like?”
asked Hal Kenyon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Most of the boys by this time had spent their
enthusiasm and settled down to quieter attention.
Seated on the grass, they waited eagerly for the
answer to Kenyon’s question. By this time a
good crowd of boys had joined the audience.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I may as well give you your first lesson in
aeroplane building right now,” began the aviator,
shifting slightly to ease his crippled limb.
“First, do you all know what a biplane is?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s an airship,” said one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, it’s an aeroplane,” corrected another.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the difference between a biplane and
a monoplane?” interposed Mr. Miles.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was a puzzler for most of the boys. After
several had answered and flunked, Hal Kenyon
spoke up:</p>

<p class='c009'>“A monoplane has one plane, and a biplane
has two planes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is a plane?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A flat surface.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good,” complimented Mr. Miles. “You know
a little geometry. The planes are the wings of
an aeroplane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, the aeroplane will be built on this plan:
The part that will interest you boys most will be
the cabin. As I said, it will carry two passengers
comfortably besides the operator. And it is to
be so arranged with an automatically shifting
weight that these passengers can move about without
disturbing the balance of the ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This will really be an airship. The ordinary
aeroplane is not entitled to such a name, for it is
merely a skeleton without any body. This vessel
will have a real body, made mostly of aluminum,
except the glass windows and ports. The
front, or prow, will be blunt in accord with the
latest ideas of air friction. The front and rear of
this cabin will be supplied with flexible slides that
may be slipped around to the sides, leaving the
front and rear open. This will remove practically
all resistance, except for perpendicular
rods six inches apart, giving the cabin something
of the appearance of a cage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In cold weather, or in high altitudes, these
slides can be closed and the cabin warmed with a
small alcohol stove. Otherwise there will be little
remarkable about the ship. You will all be interested
in such details as the motor and the steering
and weather apparatus. You will learn all
about the altitude barometer and the anemometer,
or speed measurer. In other words, you
will absorb a lot of information on air navigation
while putting this airship together.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How about that weight?” Hal questioned
as the instructor in aeronautics paused. “You
say it shifts automatically. Can you explain that
so we can understand how it keeps the ship from
turning over?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll try. The floor is of a flexible material.
As one walks here and there, it is pressed downward
and by means of a delicate mechanical device,
shifts a weight on a rod. The shifting of this
weight alters the angle of the ailerons at the ends
of the wings and prevents the machine from tipping
out of balance. Understand?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Blank looks on every face before him advised
Mr. Miles that he had been too technical for the
boys, so he added:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll understand easily as you advance in
the construction of the vessel. But possibly this
may give you a hint of what I am driving at:
Changing the angles of the ailerons has the same
effect in an up-and-down direction, as turning a
boat’s rudder has from side to side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Still few of the boys understood what he meant,
although Hal Kenyon and one or two others
believed they did. Later, when he found an opportunity,
Hal, with pencil and paper, made some
drawings and studied over them and altered them
until he was certain that he had a clear idea of
the plan. Then he took his last drawing to Mr.
Miles and explained it to him, and the aviator told
him he was right.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />THE “PAINTER”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A few days later the promised trip up Porcupine
Hill was taken. An early start was made,
the forty-four boys of the school, clad in semi-warlike
uniforms, looking like a company of young
soldiers as they marched over the hills to the
south and west toward the mountains on the right
of Mummy Cañon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile Hal, by his frank and straightforward
manner, established himself in the confidence
of Miles so well as to remove all doubt as
to his innocence regarding the disappearance of
the nuggets. The mystery remained still unsolved,
but it seemed certain that any suspicion
directed toward Hal was entirely unjust.</p>

<p class='c009'>Porcupine Hill was four miles from Lakefarm.
The easiest ascent was on the southern side, but
to reach this it would be necessary to travel an
additional two miles around the base. On that
side it was more than two miles to the peak, and
this was the course generally used by those
dwelling on the peak and the side of the mountain.
On the opposite side the ascent was shorter and
much steeper, and this was the route taken by the
boys whenever they went up to see Aunt Sarah
Jane.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. and Mrs. Turman were real uncle and aunt
of two of the boys of the school, Byron and Frank
Bowler. The aged couple were always glad to
receive their two nephews and their friends, and
took pains to make them feel welcome. Fifteen
years before, while prospecting, they had discovered
a vein of gold near the peak and had staked
out claims. But finding gold on a mountain peak
and mining it profitably are two different propositions,
and they found it necessary to do some
sharp engineering of various sorts.</p>

<p class='c009'>A company was formed and incorporation papers
taken out. Then followed negotiations with
various moneyed interests and an entanglement
that tied matters up. Since then nothing of importance
had been done.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he found that he was not going to make
his fortune in the mine, “Uncle Sam,” as Mr.
Turman was familiarly known for miles around,
desired to move to Jimtown or some other
settlement in the valley; but Aunt Sarah Jane had been
cured of rheumatism in this high and dry altitude,
and she was afraid it would come back if they
moved below. So they continued to live on the
mountain peak in their cabin of slabs and rude
timbers made warmer in winter with banks of sod
and straw heaped close and high around the
foundation.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a picturesque place, with everything
crude but neat, clean, and comfortable. The boys
always enjoyed going up there. The view was
wide and magnificent. Several towns were visible,
nestled here and there in the valleys or on the
hillsides. At night their lights shone prettily in
the deep-down distance. On one occasion while
some of the boys were on the peak, they witnessed
a storm several hundred feet below them and marveled
at the novelty of looking down upon banks
of clouds with lightning flashing among them.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the Boy Scouts had much of interest before
them when one fine morning early in September
they set out in a body to climb Porcupine Hill.
The ascent began over a slowly rising ridge of
ground that ran along the base of the mountain,
then led directly up the steep incline for some
distance, and finally lost itself in a winding trail
that curved among and about rocks and bushes
and projecting cliffs. The climb, because of its
winding nature, was much longer than a straight
course would have been, so that nearly two hours
were spent between the base and peak.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys were equipped with luncheons, water
canteens, hike-sticks, a few cameras and field-glasses.
For climbing footgear, they wore heavy
Swiss hob-nailed shoes and gaiters. Their
clothes were of strong, coarse material that would
stand much wear and resist the tearing pulls of
shrubbery and briars.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Sarah Jane was delighted to see them.
It was the first time all the Scouts of the school
had been up there together. At noon she brought
out some tablecloths and spread them on the
grass and invited the boys to prepare their dinner
picnic style. Hal and Byron took the burro belonging
to Mr. and Mrs. Turman and rode halfway
down the southern side to a neighbor’s well
and filled two large canvas bottles with water.
These they hung over the burro’s shoulders by a
strap connecting them and then began their journey
back up to the peak.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mountain was thickly wooded on this side,
but the surface was rough, and the trail consequently
very winding. Only one of the boys rode
at a time on the return trip; when one became
tired, the one on the burro dismounted and permitted
the other to ride.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this manner they had gone half of the return
distance, when suddenly something happened
that added a new sensation to their mountain
experiences. Just as they were rounding a bluff
in a sparsely wooded spot, a dark object darted
across their path, causing the burro to give a
jump so sudden as to throw Byron from its back.</p>

<p class='c009'>Like an arrow from a bow, the slow and sleepy
beast shot up the side of the mountain, leaving the
boys to the tender mercies of the cause of its
fright. At first the two Scouts were only astonished,
for they could not imagine any more dangerous
animal in that locality than a wildcat.
There were said to be a few of these in the mountains,
but they were shy and fled at the sight of
man.</p>

<p class='c009'>This beast, however, was larger than a wildcat
and did not seem to be disposed to run at the sight
of the boys. It was a slender long-limbed,
cat-like animal, with reddish-gray fur. After springing
across the path, the beast turned and seemed
to hesitate, as if not knowing whether to pursue
the burro or to direct its attention toward the
boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” Byron asked as he clung tremblingly
to his companion. He had been severely
shaken by his fall, but not seriously injured.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a mountain lion,” replied Hal with all
the steadiness of voice he could command. Being
older and larger than Byron, he felt that the responsibility
of the situation rested on him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s run,” proposed the smaller boy, tugging
at Hal’s sleeve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, we mustn’t do that,” replied the latter.
“If we stand still and don’t seem to be afraid,
he may go away and leave us alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal now had good reason to congratulate himself
on his industry during his three years at
Lakefarm. He had found much of interest in the
doctor’s library, reading everything that appealed
to his taste. Among the books that he most enjoyed
were illustrated natural histories, and it
is little wonder that he recognized now the kind
of beast before him, although he had never
before seen one. He remembered also that these
books had informed him that mountain lions are
not so fierce as commonly thought, that they usually
hunt at night and are cowardly and little to
be feared unless cornered.</p>

<p class='c009'>The puma was only a few rods away from Hal
and Byron, who stood close to the bluff that
formed a turning point in the path. For more
than a minute boys and beast stood facing each
other, neither moving. Byron wished to run and
continued to pull at his companion’s coat-sleeve,
but Hal, relying on his book information, stood
firm. Presently the beast backed away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See? What did I tell you?” exclaimed the
older boy gleefully. But his exultation was somewhat
hysterical, indicating the strain he had
undergone.</p>

<p class='c009'>The puma backed slowly at first, but presently
his retreat became more rapid. Then suddenly
he turned and, with a few bounds, disappeared
among the pine trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal was now willing to run, and both boys
started out at their best pace up the trail. The
ascent was not very steep here, so they ran some
distance before they were too tired to go farther.
Then they stopped and looked back, and, seeing
no sign of the lion, they rested a while.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then they took things a little easier, but they
went faster than they would have under ordinary
circumstances. A short distance from the top of
the mountain, they were met by all the other boys,
Dr. Byrd, Mr. Frankland, Mr. Porter, and Mr.
and Mrs. Turman, who were much excited. The
burro had returned alone and with more speed
than it had ever been known to make before.
Naturally this caused alarm, and a general rush
was made to investigate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal and Byron excitedly explained what had
happened. Then followed a rapid succession of
questions and answers until all the details of the
adventure were told. Finally Aunt Sarah Jane
added a new element of interest by saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe it was the painter I saw over on Flathead
one day. It was early in the morning and
I saw some kind of animal moving about over
there. But it was so far away I couldn’t make
out what it was. I thought at first it was a man.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c010'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />BUILDING THE AIRSHIP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Fortunately the waterbottles had been well
saddled on the burro, and it carried them safely
to the top of the mountain, in spite of its wild
flight from the lion. Everything now being ready,
the troop of Scouts returned to where the
luncheon had been spread and sat around and
ate. Of course the lion was the chief subject of
conversation at the dinner. Mr. and Mrs. Turman
both declared they were surprised at its appearance,
as they had not heard of any of its kind
in that part of the country for several years.
Naturally, too, the statement of Mrs. Turman that
she had seen a moving object that might have
been a man on top of Flathead directed some
interest toward that mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seemed to be walking erect like a man,”
she said in reply to further questions; “but it
might ’ave been the painter. I couldn’t make sure
what it was. I wish I’d had a pair of glasses like
some of you boys have.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve heard it said that there’s some cliff-dwellers’
houses over on that mountain,” volunteered
Uncle Sam. “I don’t know where the story came
from, for there’s nobody around here now that’s
ever been up there. I don’t see how anybody could
climb that mountain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s examine it with our glasses,” suggested
Byron, who had a pair slung over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>Half a dozen binoculars were quickly unslung,
and the holders were soon searching the singular
upheaval of stones and earth more than a mile
to the east.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see something that looks like some houses
right in the side of the mountain,” announced
Byron.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, there are some cliff houses,” replied
Mr. Turman. “There’s a big hollow place right
in the side of the mountain about thirty feet up.
There’s a regular cliff there, and you can see
where pieces of wood were driven in to make a
ladder to climb up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that so?” Dr. Byrd exclaimed in surprise.
“I never knew that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; there’s no road or trail along that side
of the mountain and hardly anybody ever goes
near it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well! This is a surprise to me,” declared the
doctor. “I thought I knew this country pretty
thoroughly, but it seems that a very important
feature has escaped me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Frankland and Mr. Porter knew just as little,
and the faculty of the school at once decided
that a trip of investigation should be made in the
near future.</p>

<p class='c009'>A search of the plateau, or mesa, on Flathead,
with the aid of the glasses, produced little result
of special interest. The doctor expressed considerable
surprise on finding it so large. There
was a patch of timber on the farther half, while
the nearer half was made up of several hills and
ravines and a few rocky elevations and bluffs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d give a good deal to get up there and examine
that mesa,” said Dr. Byrd. “We might find
something interesting. There’s a glittering spot
near the middle that looks as if it might be water
shining in the sunlight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know how we can get up there,” Hal
announced with sudden eagerness. Everybody
turned toward him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How?” asked Pickles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In Mr. Miles’ airship when it’s finished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a brilliant idea,” laughed the doctor.
“Well, Hal, if anybody besides Mr. Miles himself
makes that trip, you ought to be allowed to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can I?” Kenyon asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, of course not. I was only joking. Really,
I’d like to see you all make the trip, but you know
it’s out of the question.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Three hours were spent by the Scout company
on the top of the mountain. They visited the
shafts that had been sunk by the aged miner and
heard him tell of how wealthy he might have
become had it not been for people who schemed
against him. They traveled over every foot of
the wooded peak, making note of curious formations
and conditions and gaining much information.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then they set out on their return, making the
descent a little to the west of their ascent. During
all their stay on the mountain and their return
to Lakefarm they kept a keen lookout for the panther,
but saw nothing of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When Mr. Miles gets well and his new airship
is finished, maybe he’ll hunt the mountain
lion like an eagle,” suggested Hal to several of
the boys on the way down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My! wouldn’t it be great if we could go with
him,” said Lee Huff with explosive enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If they don’t chain me to the earth, I don’t
see how I’ll keep from running off with the airship,”
said Frank Bowler.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, you’d do wonders, you would,” Pickles
sniffed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’d likely turn acrobat and tumble into the
cañon,” Hal suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then he’d he stuck up on Flathead for
another mummy,” chuckled Ferdinand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aw! close your face or I’ll clip you one,”
Frank snapped, a little provoked. He was forgetting
his voluntary promise not to make any more
such rash threats. If Dr. Byrd had heard this
threat, doubtless Bad would have been reminded
of his resolution.</p>

<p class='c009'>They arrived at the school without further
incident, and next day the aviator listened to a
chorus of stories of their experiences on the mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the suggestion was repeated that he
hunt the mountain lion in his new airship as soon
as it was finished, Mr. Miles replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a good idea and I promise you I’ll follow
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the sportsmen of the town were not content
to sit idly by and wait for an injured stranger
to recover, build an aeroplane, and carry off such
rare game, together with all honors. No sooner
did they hear of the presence of a puma in the
neighborhood than hunting parties began to form
and to scour the mountains in search of the big
cat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several days went by but the results were uniformly
unsatisfactory, for no trace of the puma
was discovered. The boys of the school desired
to take part in the search, but Dr. Byrd would
not grant permission. He did not regard it safe
for so many boys to be at large in the mountains
with guns, and no guns were kept at the school.
They would have been glad to take part in the
hunt with clubs and bows and arrows, for they
were skilled in the use of the latter, but the doctor
did not take kindly to this suggestion either.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile the parts of the new airship arrived
at the school. They were carefully crated and
were conveyed over the government road from
the nearest railroad station in two wagons. It
was a day of much excitement when they arrived,
interest in the mountain lion being almost entirely
eclipsed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the work of putting together the parts of
the novel aeroplane began. Perhaps forty-four
boys never before worked so industriously. There
was little use of expecting them to do much of
anything else during the period and consequently
Dr. Byrd wisely suspended temporarily the ordinary
routine of the school. The institution was
transformed into an airship factory for several
days, the work progressing slowly in order that a
thorough study of aviation might be made along
with the mechanical construction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally the task was completed, and a temporary
hangar was put up at one corner of the campus.
In fact this structure was the last, or finishing
shop of the factory, for it was here that the
final preparations for flying were made.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Miles was able to walk with the leg that
had been broken, but he still used a crutch, and did
little but superintend the job. One morning the
new air vessel was wheeled out of the hangar
and onto the campus, and as the forty-four Boy
Scouts circled around and gazed upon the result
of their work, a ringing cheer of triumph awoke
the echoes of the distant hills.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fly, Mr. Miles, fly!” yelled one youthful
enthusiast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not yet,” replied the convalescent aviator.
“Wait until these bones mend good and solid, and
then I’ll soar around those mountains like an
eagle. I’ll explore Flathead and I’ll find the
mountain lion too, if he hasn’t left this part of the
country.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c010'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />STOLEN WEALTH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>There was special reason why Dr. Byrd should
feel more than ordinary interest in Mr. Miles.
Both of them had long been enthusiastic collectors
of souvenirs and curios of many kinds, and it was
not long after their first meeting that each of them
discovered the similarity of their hobbies. They
were together frequently thereafter, both in the
hospital and out of it. They talked of the places
they had visited and the sights they had seen
and the curios they had collected until it seemed
almost that they must have been companions in
all their travels and all their hunts.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Dr. Byrd pulled out some of his trunks,
opened them and disclosed a wealth of treasures
such as caused the eyes of the aviator to stand
out big with astonishment. This treasure was
not so remarkable in money value, perhaps; but it
was indeed wonderful in novelty and abundance.</p>

<p class='c009'>An idea of the nature of this collection may be
presented by a description of a few samples. One
of them was an oriental jewel casket of engraved
rock and crystal mounted in enameled silver. Two
other articles of special interest, because of their
rarity, were a set of checkers made of sharks’
vertebrae and an “eye” from an Egyptian
mummy case. This eye was made of bronze and
black and white marble.</p>

<p class='c009'>A long chapter could be devoted to a description
of the doctor’s collection. As he exhibited them
to Mr. Miles he handed over for inspection some
Abalone pearls of California, blister pearls of
Ceylon, a necklace of fluorescent amber from Sicily,
jade ornaments, smoky quartz, Brazilian crystal
balls, topaz from the Ural mountains, petrified
wood, moss agate, rainbow agate, bloodstone from
India, sardonyx from Uruguay, a Texan jasperized
wood ornament, a jasper tray from the Ural
mountains, fire opals, Norwegian sunstone, and
an enameled talisman necklace.</p>

<p class='c009'>Undoubtedly Dr. Byrd valued this collection
much higher than a disinterested authority would
have valued it, but there is little doubt also that
it would have brought a considerable sum even at
an auction sale. Nevertheless, the owner of Lakefarm
could not throw off something of an air of
sadness as he was exhibiting his treasured gems
and curios.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two years ago,” he remarked to the aviator,
“I could have shown you a collection that would
have opened your eyes much wider. I then had a
dozen other stones that were worth several times
as much as all of these together, but they were
stolen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did a burglar break in?” asked Mr. Miles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I wouldn’t feel so badly if they had gone
in such manner. But it was a trusted employe
that took them. He had been a teacher at the
school for a year and I grew to like him exceedingly.
He was really a brilliant fellow and I
admired him. In fact, I gave him my full confidence.
At the end of his year he resigned, and a
few days later I discovered my loss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Couldn’t you find him?” inquired Mr. Miles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly. That’s what made it so hard to
prove anything against him. He was the smoothest
kind, all nerve and calculation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you know he took them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t you ever know anything you couldn’t
prove?” replied the doctor slowly. “I knew who
stole those gems the instant I found them missing.
Immediately I saw his excellent qualities in a new
light. He was an extremely clever hypocrite.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you meet him afterward?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I never saw him again. I put it up to the
police. I told them of my suspicions, but couldn’t
give them any information that tended to fasten
guilt on Maxwell any more than on anybody else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maxwell was his name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. The police worked a while on the case,
but gradually gave it up. Then I wrote to Maxwell
and informed him plainly where my suspicion
rested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He wrote a reply full of indignation and
reproach, but it didn’t ring true. I’ve noticed the
smartest rascals seem to be unable to seem entirely
innocent when they know they are suspected. It’s
a remarkable study, criminology. And yet, it’s
as simple as A-B-C.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In what way?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything’s simple when you understand it,
I’m ready to believe. If we could learn the secret
of the universe, we’d be astonished to find out
what a simple proposition it is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re getting pretty deep,” smiled Miles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps I am. But I’m confident that the
effects of dishonesty on the dishonest person are
similar to the effects of the use of an untrue
square in the construction of a building. He absolutely
can’t help growing out of plumb. When you
appreciate that rule, you will understand how I
knew that Maxwell committed the theft.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was months after the resignation of Rodney
Maxwell before the boys of Lakefarm learned of
the stealing of the gems, and then the information
came to them in a vague manner. Pepperill Humphrey
let the first hint drop, and the curiosity of
the young Scouts would not let him alone until he
revealed some more of his information. Pepper
had many good qualities, but he was very talkative,
and did not require much pumping to set
him going in earnest, and soon the secret ceased to
be a secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conversations between the doctor and Mr.
Miles on the subject of their collections led to a
move highly pleasing to the Boy Scouts of Lakefarm.
Dr. Byrd had several times expressed a
desire to explore the cave behind the waterfall,
where the aviator’s lost bag of souvenirs had been
found. To both of them this cave was a place of
some mystery, and naturally they felt considerable
interest in a solution.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d like to know how that bag got in there,”
said the doctor one day. “And the first step toward
finding out must consist of an inspection of
the cave and its immediate vicinity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I agree with you,” returned Miles. “I’d
like to go with you when you inspect the place,
but it’ll be a week or two before I can stand any
vigorous exercise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems to me that you’re entitled to accompany
the first expedition of discovery,” continued
the doctor slowly. “But, as you say, you won’t
be able to move about in a lively manner for some
time. Now, I have a plan. It’s been working in
my mind for several days, and I’ve about decided
to put it into execution.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is this: Mummy Cañon is really a remarkable
place. It’s a wonder to me that it hasn’t been
exploited as a resort long before this. I’m seriously
considering, Mr. Miles, a plan to purchase
the whole of the cañon from the government and
to enter on an extensive real estate project.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I’ll incorporate, but I propose to
retain a controlling interest in the stock company.
I’ll buy the land, get out my incorporation papers,
and then invite some eastern promoters here to
look at my proposition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m dead sure the thing could be made a success.
The D. and R. G. railroad is about to run
a short line this way, and with a little advertising
we’d soon have all the people out here we could
take care of. A hotel, some cottages, and conveniences
for sportsmen and sight-seers ought to
start things humming.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the cave would be an important attraction.
But it must be made accessible. So I have
planned to give the boys a little experience in
bridge and road engineering. I want to construct
a foot bridge over the river near the rapids and
dig a walk along the steep western bank right up
to the cave. I would put up railings to make it
safe and a well-protected bridge from the bank
through the fall into the cave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a great idea!” exclaimed Miles,
enthusiastically slapping his sound leg. “When
are you going to begin work?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a day or two. I’ve so nearly decided to
put the big scheme into operation that I’ve already
begun action on the smaller one. The lumber for
the bridges and railing will be delivered at the
cañon to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good! I’m heartily in sympathy with the
work. The boys will like it too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I’ve had the boys in mind all the time,”
declared the doctor warmly. “The young Scouts
of Lakefarm, I intend, shall have much to do in
the building up of Mummy Cañon. The work will
be full of lessons in engineering, construction and
business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course the boys were delighted when they
were informed of this plan. The doctor did not
tell them of the larger scheme he had in view, as
that was not yet fully decided upon.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few days later work was begun. The lumber
had been delivered at the shallow place near
the head of the rapids, which was the place selected
for bridge number one. The stream was wide
at this place, but this width suited the purpose of
Dr. Byrd the better, for he desired a task worthy
of the efforts of forty-four energetic boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>First, it was necessary to put in foundations
for the abutments and supports of the bridge.
This was done by gathering stones and bowlders
and wedging them in place as securely as possible.
Then followed the task of sawing the timbers
into proper lengths, according to plans that had
been prepared under the supervision of Mr. Frankland
and Mr. Porter. This done, the frame work
was put up and the planks nailed down and the
railings placed.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was really a very satisfactory piece of work.
First of all, it was stable and safe to walk upon.
Second, it presented a neat appearance. Third,
the boys had done it all themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bridge was finished in two working days.
The doctor, in mapping out the program, provided
for alternate days of work at the river and study
at the school, so that three days elapsed before the
bridge was completed. Then another day was
spent at their books, after which the boys returned
to the cañon and began making a level foot-path
along the steep western bank of the river.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was done in short shifts in order that the
work might be pushed rapidly without fatigue.
Half a dozen picks and shovels were kept swinging
vigorously and the way the earth and stones
went flying into the river said the work would
soon be done.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two weeks after the starting of the work on the
larger bridge the entire work was finished. There
was a strong railing on the river side of the path
and a narrow well-protected bridge through the
waterfall to the cave behind. It was nearly night
when the last nail was driven, and as they had
no lanterns with them, it was decided not to explore
the cave on this occasion, but to reserve this
inspection for a special excursion on a later day.</p>

<p class='c009'>That evening at Lakefarm, however, something
happened that was destined to bring about
a decided change in the program with reference to
this plan. The person most affected was Hal
Kenyon. It meant trouble for him and some
extremely perilous adventures for some of the
boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the wash room Hal drew a handkerchief from
his pocket, and as he did so something heavy and
metallic hit the floor. Several of his schoolmates
heard the sound, and Pickles sprang forward and
picked up the object. As he did this, Hal also
made a spring and attempted to snatch it away
from Pickles.</p>

<p class='c009'>The latter, however, with no uncivil intent,
edged away, at the same time gazing eagerly at
the small, heavy object in his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Hal, it’s gold!” he exclaimed. “Where
did you get it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that?” inquired a voice that chilled
Kenyon through, and, looking up, he saw Mr.
Miles advancing toward them. He had discarded
his crutches and was using a cane.</p>

<p class='c009'>He held out his free hand toward Pickles, who,
like one hypnotized, delivered the object of interest
to the aviator. The latter looked at it eagerly
for a moment, then fastened his eyes on Hal with
searching gaze.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boy,” he said sternly after a moment’s
silence; “this nugget is mine. I thought you
said—”</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not finish the sentence, for Hal’s face had
become so pale that it seemed as if he was going
to faint.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c010'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />FLIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>If Mr. Johnson Miles had charged him of theft
with a loud voice, Hal could not have felt the
accusation more keenly than he felt it in the aviator’s
look and tones. And the worst feature of
the situation was the fact that the finger of circumstantial
proof pointed directly at the boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>At first, almost overcome with dismay, Hal
suddenly realized the injustice of the suspicion
against him, and stiffening with anger, he blazed
forth:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean, sir? Do you mean to say
that I stole it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Miles did not answer the question. He
merely looked stern and asked another, while a
score of boys gathered around, gazing on the two
with startled wonder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you tell me where you got it?” inquired
Mr. Miles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir, I can,” Hal replied defiantly. “I
found it in the cave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where you found my bag of souvenirs?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why didn’t you turn it over to me with the
bag?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I didn’t find them at the same time.
I found that nugget to-day after we finished the
bridge through the waterfall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why didn’t you say something about it? Why
did you hide it in your pocket and keep still? A
boy would naturally become pretty excited on finding
a gold nugget.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t hide it in my pocket,” was Hal’s
choking reply. “I didn’t know what it was and
just stuck it in my pocket.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why didn’t you throw it away?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wasn’t like an ordinary stone. It was
heavy, and I wanted to look at it in the light.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are the rest of them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mean the other nuggets,” said the aviator
with continued sternness. “There were six in the
bag.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment Hal’s eye blazed with indignation;
then his spirit seemed to collapse. The
implied charge and the suspicious circumstances
were too much for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know,” he said hoarsely, and with a
furtive glance at the boys around him, he walked
out of the wash room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal was late at supper that evening. In fact,
there were only a few left at the tables when he
entered the dining room. He took a seat at a
table alone and ate in moody silence. He felt
bitter and wished he could leave the school never
to return, although no experience in his life had
ever been more pleasant than his three years at
Lakefarm.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was the second time that suspicion had
been directed toward him regarding the disappearance
of the aviator’s nuggets, and now he
could see no possible way of proving his innocence.
Unluckily, he had had no idea of the real
nature of his find until Walter Hurst pronounced
it gold and the owner appeared on the scene and
claimed it.</p>

<p class='c009'>After supper he went gloomily to his room and
sat down and waited to be summoned to the doctor’s
office. Of course, Mr. Miles had gone
straight to Dr. Byrd and informed him of the
scene in the wash room, and the owner of Lakefarm
would soon call Hal to account.</p>

<p class='c009'>But no call came, and Hal soon found himself
imagining all sorts of direful explanations of the
seeming inactivity. Probably the doctor had sent
for the town marshal to come and take the nugget-thief
to jail. Or possibly the owner of the school
had decided to have nothing more to do with this
bad boy and was even now writing to his father
to come and take him away.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a short time Hal had worked himself up to
a very nervous and unhappy state. Then he began
to plan wildly how he might escape the undeserved
punishment that he saw ahead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I could run Mr. Miles’ airship I’d fly away
in it,” he said bitterly. “And it’d serve him
right, too. He didn’t have any business to condemn
me without a hearing. He might have given
me the benefit of the doubt until I’d had a chance
to prove I was innocent. But I couldn’t prove
anything with him looking at me that way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello, Hal, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pickles, his roommate, interrupted his unhappy
reverie with this cheery interrogation as he
entered the room. Pickles was a quiet little fellow
who seldom took anything very seriously and had a
habit of stealing on one and surprising him with
an unexpected “boo!” Hal started visibly on
this occasion, much to the glee of Pickles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter?” repeated the smaller
boy as he observed the glum look on Hal’s face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing,” was the half surly reply; “only
I’m goin’ to run away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run away! Hal! What for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t speak so loud, Pick,” cautioned Hal.
“Yes, I’ve really made up my mind. I’m going
to-night; and I want you to keep my secret.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Hal, you mustn’t,” Pickles gasped under
his breath. “What would I do here without you?
You’re the best friend I’ve got.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kenyon was surprised. He had had no idea
that any of his associates regarded him with such
affection, and this manifestation moved him not a
little.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pickles,” he said warmly; “you’re a peach
of a kid. I’ve never got mad at you since I first
met you, and you’ve never got mad at me. That’s
sayin’ a whole lot. Some kids you’ve got to get
mad at every minute to keep ’em from walking all
over you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bad, for instance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—and no. Bad’s a bad one unless you
know how to handle him. We’ve always been good
friends, and I like him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So do I, but he’s mean sometimes. I like Bun
better. But what you going to run away for, Hal?
Is it the nugget?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—and Mr. Miles. He thinks I’m a thief.
And so do all the rest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t, Hal, if you say you’re not,” declared
the faithful Walter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pickles, you’re the best fellow on earth,”
said Kenyon warmly, stepping close and putting
both hands on his friend’s shoulders. “You
almost make me feel like sticking. But I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not, Hal?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everybody—excepting you—thinks I’m a
thief, and I can’t prove I’m not. So I’m just going
to cut loose. Some day I’ll come back and
prove I’m innocent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry I picked up the nugget, Hal. I
wish I hadn’t told what it was. But I was so surprised
I couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all right, Pick. It wasn’t your fault.
I don’t blame you a bit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When you goin’, Hal?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-night—just as soon as everybody’s
asleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where you going—home?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know. Maybe; maybe not. Anyway,
I’ll write home and tell mother and father I didn’t
steal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me go with you, Hal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Pickles, you mustn’t think of doing such
a thing. You must stay here and tell them all
I’m not a thief. Oh, Pick, it’s terrible to be called
such a thing. You don’t know how I feel about
it. Your father’s rich and mine’s poor, but I
wouldn’t steal if I was starving—any more’n you
would. Even when I was selling newspapers in
Denver and making only half or quarter of a cent
on each paper, I couldn’t think of stealing. I’d
run a block to catch a man if I found I’d given
him the wrong change. I’ll write to Dr. Byrd and
tell him all about it, for I’ll have to thank him for
what he has done for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hal, I’ll do anything you want me to, but I’d
rather go along. If you’ll wait, I’ll write to my
father and he’ll come here and fix everything up
for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, it’s all settled what I’m going to do,” Hal
answered determinedly. “You stay here, and
when I get settled in a job somewhere, I’ll write
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it’s half an hour till bedtime,” said
Pickles. “I’m going out till then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t give me away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should say not. You’ll be here when I come
back?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Walter slipped softly out of the room, as was
his custom. In the library he found Fes Sharer
and whispered a few words in his ear. Then the
two started out on a hunt and soon rounded up
Bun and Bad. The four chums then held a whispered
conference out on the lawn. As they separated,
Pickles said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Remember, in an hour, under the big poplar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Half an hour after bedtime, three boys might
have been seen to slip out of a window of the
dormitory to the ground. It was dark, the stars
twinkling sharply in the clear sky. Swiftly they
sped away from the building, along the edge of the
campus and two hundred yards beyond, until they
came to a great tall tree, whose abundant branches
and foliage hugged close and tapering to the
trunk. There they stopped, sat down, with the
tree between themselves and the school, and whispered
excitedly to each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ten minutes later another dark form emerged
from another window of the dormitory and took
a similar course. He carried a bundle under one
arm. Hardly had he left the shadow of the school
buildings and the bordering trees when another
youth slipped from the same window and followed
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three forms under the tree hugged close
to the ground as the boy with the bundle passed
within twenty feet of them. Presently the fifth
boy reached the tree and the three forms under it
stood erect.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on,” beckoned the last youth, and all
four started in pursuit of the one ahead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently the latter heard a footstep behind
and threw a startled look backward. With a half-choked
cry of astonishment, he broke into a run
and fairly flew along the road that led toward
Mummy Cañon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />EXPLORING THE CAVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Hal! Oh, Hal! Stop! This is Pickles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal stopped almost as suddenly as he had
started to run. He recognized the cautious cry of
his friend and waited for the four to overtake him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What you kids up to?” he inquired, after
scanning the faces of the quartet. “I told you
not to come, Pickles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re not going to run away with you,” he
replied. “We’re just going to walk a ways and
then go back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad to have you come, but you might
get into trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, we won’t,” declared Frank with something
of his old-time boastfulness. “We can get
back any time before morning and nobody’ll ever
see us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where you going to-night?” inquired Ferdinand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the cave first.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the cañon?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I want to see if there’s any more of
those nuggets there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You haven’t any light,” reminded Byron.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but I’ve got some matches.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know where the lanterns are,” Frank
announced. “They’re in the garage, and I can
crawl in through the window. Let’s get them and
explore the cave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, let’s do,” Ferdinand said eagerly.
“Come on, Bad. You and I’ll go an’ get the
lanterns, while the rest wait here for us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>No objection being offered to this plan, Frank
and Ferdinand made a dash back toward the
garage. They were gone about fifteen minutes
and returned with four lanterns. Then the march
toward the cañon was taken up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course, there was much excited talk on the
way. Every one of the self-appointed committee
that was “seeing Hal off” expressed confidence
in his integrity and all were highly indignant at
Mr. Miles’ suspicions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’d better go take a jump in the lake,” said
Byron with unwonted vehemence. “He’s got no
’preciation of what you did for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, if it hadn’t been for Hal, he’d probably
never have got any of his specimens back at all,”
observed Ferdinand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somebody ought to slip him one,” declared
Frank savagely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think he meant to be so hard on me,”
interposed Hal charitably. “I was pretty sore
at first, but when I saw how bad things looked
for me, I wanted to get out. I wouldn’t have run
away, but I don’t believe I could ever prove I
wasn’t a thief. When you get in a fix like that,
the best thing to do is to pack up and move.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The interest the boys felt in the cave they were
about to explore finally resulted in a change of
subject, and Hal’s troubles were forgotten for the
time being. In fact, Hal himself forgot much of
the bitterness of his woes in the general eagerness
of the conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Arrived at the scene of their construction work
in the cañon, they lost no time in crossing the
river and hastening up the walk to the waterfall
cave. Outside the latter they stopped only long
enough to light two of the lanterns. The other
two they found without oil and set them aside.
Then they crossed the second bridge into the cave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal now assumed the leadership. He realized
that the expedition was not without danger and
felt the responsibility for the safety of his friends
to be resting on his own shoulders. His first act,
therefore, on entering the cave was to drive the
other boys back several feet from the precipice
and the roaring waterfall. Then he led them
beyond the bend in the passage to the farther end
of the cave, where the noise of the fall was not so
deafening as to prevent conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You kids stay back here and explore this
part while I go up in front and see if I can find
any more of those nuggets,” suggested Hal, concealing
by his manner his real motive in assigning
them well back from the danger point. He
knew that if he told them he was afraid they would
get too close to the edge and fall over, some or all
of them would be determined to hover close to
the cataract.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal returned to the mouth of the cave with one
of the lanterns. He could not help shuddering
a little as he approached the edge of the precipice,
and being of practical mind, he soon found
himself speculating on a method of making this
point more safe for visitors.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There ought to be a fence or high railing along
here to prevent people from getting too close and
falling in,” he told himself. “If Dr. Byrd wants
to invite people to visit this cave, he ought to
make it safe. I think I’ll suggest this to him—”</p>

<p class='c009'>His soliloquy was interrupted suddenly when he
awoke to the fact that he was running away and
did not intend to return to the doctor’s school.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My, what a fool I am!” he exclaimed. “I
think I’m losing my head. Really, I wish I wasn’t
running away. I do hate to go. But—but—I’ve
got to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He flashed his lantern about and began his
search for the lost nuggets. He examined the floor
and several crevices in the walls for fifteen or
twenty minutes, but nothing rewarded his search.
How the one nugget he had found got there was
as big a mystery as the presence of the bag of
souvenirs in the cave had been.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally he gave it up and went back to the
farther part of the cave and rejoined the other
boys. Byron and Walter were gazing upward at
Frank and Ferdinand who were climbing up the
wall on the right, which inclined like the side of a
mountain. Fes carried the lantern.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look out, up there; don’t fall, or there’ll be
some broken bones, and maybe necks,” warned
Hal. “We don’t want any such accidents to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re all right; just watch us,” answered
Frank with his usual bravado.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where you going?” inquired Hal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As high as we can,” replied Ferdinand
“Come on up. It isn’t steep. It’s easy climbing.
You couldn’t fall in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Fes and Frank were by this time fifty or sixty
feet from the floor, and the light of their lantern
still revealed no sign of a ceiling, or a converging
of the walls overhead. This was rather astonishing,
and Hal was moved with a desire to take part
in the upward exploration.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going up, too,” he announced to Byron
and Walter. “It doesn’t look steep and it’s rough
enough to give a good foothold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s climb up with ’em, Pick,” suggested
Byron.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” answered Pickles, suiting the
action to the word. In a moment all three were
following the two leaders up the almost stair-like
ascent. They climbed rapidly, for the success of
Fes and Frank had given them confidence. Up,
up, they went, Hal leading and Byron and Walter
following in respective order.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly they were startled by a succession of
cries from above. They stopped and looked upward
apprehensively, and were surprised to see
Fes and Frank standing on a ledge and looking
down upon them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, come on, kids,” yelled Frank.
“We’re clear through the roof. It’s all open up
here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thrilled by this announcement, Hal quickened
his steps and those behind him did likewise. In
a few moments they had climbed up to where the
leaders were waiting for them. Frank had spoken
truly. They were standing on a level spot several
yards in diameter; on one side arose a perpendicular
wall of the mountain and on the other, far
below, they looked down into the deep shadows of
Mummy Cañon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My! isn’t this great!” Hal exclaimed enthusiastically.
“We’re real discoverers. Maybe nobody’s
ever been up here before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nobody ever tried to climb Flathead, they
say,” Byron observed. “I bet nobody ever got
as high as this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder if we couldn’t climb higher from
here,” said Fes, scanning the perpendicular wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That doesn’t look much like it,” said Pickles
with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish the moon’d come out so we could see
farther,” said Hal. “I hate to come so far as
this and stop.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these words, he flashed the rays of his lantern
about. At one edge of the wall they found
a break that looked like the mouth of a passage,
but it was blocked by a large bowlder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to climb over it,” said Hal. “Here,
Fes, give me a boost.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Fes did as requested. With his lantern in one
hand, Hal was boosted up to the top of the bowlder,
which was about five feet through and perfectly
round.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, there’s a passage here,” he announced.
“Come on over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By a series of boosts, Byron, Frank, and Fes
climbed over the big rock, the latter stopping on
top of the bowlder to reach assistance to Walter.
After they had passed this barrier, Ferd stopped
to examine it more carefully and then said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s try to push the rock over a little. It’s
balanced here on a little neck. Maybe we can
move it so we won’t have to climb over it when
we come back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal had gone on ahead a short distance and paid
little attention to this suggestion until he turned
his head and saw his four companions with their
shoulders to the bowlder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hey! Stop! Stop!” he cried out frantically,
realizing what would happen if they moved the
rock.</p>

<p class='c009'>But his warning was too late. Even as he
screamed his command, the balanced rock toppled
over and rolled heavily down the slight incline
right into the mouth of the roof exit of the cave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! if it would only go through!” was Hal’s
wild wish. But it didn’t. The runaway sprang
past his friends, lantern in hand, and made a hasty
examination.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bowlder was wedged fast, effectually blocking
their only avenue of escape from the steep-walled
mountain.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />THE ISLAND IN THE AIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For a minute, perhaps, not a word was uttered.
The hopelessness of their situation was all too
evident to the five boys. No one dared to suggest
that the passage from which they had rolled the
bowlder would lead to any possibility of escape.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now you have done it!” Hal gasped at length.
“How in the world are we ever going to get out
of this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nobody answered. There was no reply to make.
The situation was too fearful to permit of excuses
or shifting responsibility.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal was the only member of the party who did
not seem to be paralyzed. He advanced toward the
bowlder and flashed his lantern over it. The
opening in the rocky cliff was not entirely closed,
but the rock was wedged in such a position that
it was folly to try to make an exit here. The top
of the crevice filled by the big stone converged
almost to a point, the rest of the opening, eight
or ten feet long and three or four feet wide, being
over a sheer drop of thirty feet. There was no
possibility of creeping around the bowlder and
gaining a footing on the slanting cave wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“C-can’t we break the ground here and make
the stone fall down?” suggested Ferdinand in
chattering accents.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Break the ground?” Hal replied fiercely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you see we’re standing on granite? You
could hardly break it with dynamite—and we
haven’t even a wooden crowbar, to say nothing of
a pick. I don’t know what we’re going to do.
We’ll starve to death. I guess the only thing we
can do is to sit down an’ wait till morning,”
announced Hal gloomily as he finished his inspection.
“I wonder what time it is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Byron looked at his watch and announced that
it was nearly midnight. Then Hal continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see that we can do anything before
daylight. Let’s all huddle up close together and
go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This seemed to be the most sensible thing to
do. The summer nights in Colorado are cool, and
the boys found it necessary to huddle together in
order to keep warm. Of course, they did not go
to sleep at once. There were several reasons
why it was difficult for them to drift off into slumber.
First, they were in trouble, serious trouble;
second, their bed was very hard; third, the place
was wild, and the noises were strange. Then the
moon arose, giving the scene a most lonesome
appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'>But at last all consciousness left the strange
camp, and the next thing the boys knew it was
morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal awoke first. He suddenly found himself
wondering at the hardness of his bed; then, like
a flash, the truth came back to him. Quietly he
arose, gazed a moment at his sleeping companions
and then turned toward the blocked exit. Another
examination of the roof-opening of the cave proved
that he had judged rightly. Certainly there was
no possibility of their escaping this way without
a pick or other steel tool.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next he turned his attention toward the passage
from which the heavy bowlder had been rolled.
It seemed almost as if this way must have been
cut by the hand of man. It ran with considerable
upward incline between the bulk of the mountain
and a huge rocky bluff.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaving his companions still asleep, Hal started
up this pass, which ran a hundred feet through
almost solid rock. Underfoot it was rough, with
rocky projections and bowlders, but the boy passed
over it rapidly until he reached the end. Here he
found himself at the foot of a wooded slope, not
so very steep, that ran upward for several hundred
feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I believe we could climb the mountain
from this point,” he exclaimed half-aloud.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a ledge up there that runs right over
the Mummy, and there’s another slope over that
and then some rocks. It doesn’t look nearly so
steep up here. I’m going back and wake the fellows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He hastened back and found Byron and Walter
sitting up and looking around them. Remembering
his predicament, Pickles began to sniffle with
fright. This awakened Frank and Fes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, fellows!” exclaimed Hal eagerly, “I’ve
made a wonderful discovery.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pickles ceased to cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you found a way down?” inquired Ferd.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, not yet, but maybe we’ll find one. But I
believe we can climb up to the top.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On top of Flathead!” Byron exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, on top of Flathead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What good will that do us?” inquired Frank.
“That won’t help us get down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know—it may,” replied Hal hopefully.
“Anyway, it’s better than staying here.
We’re a long distance from the road, and the
bushes growing along the edge here would keep
anybody from seeing us. Maybe we can throw
some stones down and attract somebody’s attention
over near the pass.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This suggestion struck the others as a good
one, and they were all ready in an instant to begin
the climb. They realized that they would soon
be hungry and thirsty and that they must do
something soon. So they started without further
delay.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ascent up the wooded incline was quickly
made and in twenty minutes they were standing
on the ledge over the Mummy. Here they stopped
a short while and rested. They looked eagerly
along the government road for travelers, but saw
none. Then they started upward again.</p>

<p class='c009'>After passing through a second belt of timber,
the boys found it necessary to follow a winding
course, along ledges, around steep places, then
up a slope less steep, but rocky. From a distance
this ascent appeared much steeper than it
proved to be in the climbing, and at no time did
the boys feel they were in danger of falling.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last they reached the top. The journey upward
had seemed much longer than it really was,
for they had had no breakfast. Of course they
were very hungry, but fortunately they had found
a clear spring on the way up and quenched their
thirst with deep satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ordinarily their interest in this newly discovered
country—for the top of the mountain seemed
almost extensive enough to be termed a country—would
have been eager, but under the present circumstances
a vastly more important question
occupied their minds. They had come up in order
to get down, and they now directed their attention
to devising a plan.</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately they began an exploration of the
mountain top in the hope of finding a way to
get down. This flat-top area was fairly regular
in circumference and half a mile in diameter. On
reaching the highest point of their climb, they
rested for half an hour and then started to walk
around the edge.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their view of the mesa through field-glasses
from Porcupine Hill a few weeks before proved
to have afforded them a fairly accurate idea of
the top of Flathead. The eastern half was covered
with a growth of spruce, the western half
was rather hilly and craggy, and in the center was
a pool of water, occupying a hollow that seemed
to be the catch-basin of the whole expanse.</p>

<p class='c009'>The exploration of the plateau was begun at a
southeastern point and the boys decided to take
a course northward along the eastern edge. This
took them through the wooded section. After
they had proceeded a quarter of a mile or more
they found themselves on a great ledge within
a stone’s throw, it seemed, of the government
road.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eagerly they scanned the highway for passing
teams, and they were not disappointed. Two
were approaching from the south and one from
the north, the latter just entering the cañon
through the northern pass. Hal picked up a stone
half as big as his fist and hurled it out toward the
road.</p>

<p class='c009'>The result was disheartening. He had
miscalculated the distance. The stone fell into the river,
fifty yards short of the highway.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My goodness!” Hal exclaimed. “We can’t
attract anybody’s attention that way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s holler,” suggested Frank. “Maybe
they can hear us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>All joined in a lusty scream, which, too, was
disappointing, for they felt instinctively, after it
died away, that it had not penetrated far below.
None of the travelers seemed to pay any attention
to it. If they heard it, they caught no significance
in the sound.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got to do something else,” Hal
announced desperately. He did his best to appear
cheerful, but as he looked into the tired faces of
his companions, he felt his heart sink heavily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s make some bows and arrows,” Pickles
suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pick, you’re a peach!” Hal exclaimed.
“That’s just the thing. We’ll tie some notes to
arrows and shoot ’em at the people passing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll have to hit them or they probably won’t
see the arrows,” was Byron’s advice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve got a scheme to make ’em hear the
arrows,” announced Hal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How?” asked Fes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Make whistles on the ends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys had done this before by way of amusement.
All of them were skilled in making whistles
of any twig or small limb from which the
bark could be removed in the form of a tube.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We haven’t got any string to make a bow,”
Frank objected.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes we have,” replied Kenyon, holding up his
runaway bundle of clothes, around which was
wound a liberal supply of fishline.</p>

<p class='c009'>Realizing that their situation was desperate,
the boys set to work with a will. Fes and Byron
made a bow, while Hal and the other two boys
began a search for arrow wood. They found a
patch of shrubbery that contained an abundance
of long straight stems, and they cut a score or
more of these and made them into arrows. By
this time the bow-makers had produced a good
mountain-ash bow with a strong string of several
fish-cord strands, and Hal and his helpers had
three whistle-arrows ready to shriek a novel message
through the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal now tore several leaves from a notebook,
inscribed messages of distress on them and
wrapped one around each of the arrows and tied
it fast. Then he took his stand on the ledge overlooking
the road in the cañon, while the other
boys, seated on the ground, made more whistle-arrows.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Kenyon fitted an arrow to the bow,
and the shaft-makers sprang to their feet to watch
the effect of his first shot. The whistle-tipped
stem flew with a sharp, piercing sound that thrilled
all with hope. Eagerly they followed its flight,
while the shriek died away and the arrow sped
far out and down, just beyond the road and the
traveler at whom the shaft was aimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll attract his attention pretty soon if I can
keep on makin’ as good shots as that,” declared
Hal as he let fly another arrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was impossible to determine whether or not
the attention of the driver in the buggy had been
attracted by the first two whistling-arrows, but
the third certainly had a startling effect. The
boys high overhead saw the horse suddenly spring
forward and race along the road at a break-neck
speed. Around a curve he went, the carriage
tipping over and spilling its occupant out. The
horse tore loose from the harness fastenings and
sped madly along the road, past a team coming
from the opposite direction, and out through the
northern pass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is he killed?” gasped Byron.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” replied Hal, leaning forward eagerly.
“See, he’s got up and is running after his horse.
I hope he finds the arrow and reads the note.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You hit the horse, didn’t you?” Frank
inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must have, unless it was the whistle that
scared him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With feelings of deep disappointment, the boys
watched the man run, or walk rapidly, along the
road until he disappeared through the pass.
Meanwhile the work of making more whistle-arrows
continued, and several were sent screaming
down toward two other teams that had
appeared in view. Evidently, the attention of
the occupants of these carriages was attracted by
the strange sound in the air, but none of the note-bearing
shafts were discovered by them.</p>

<p class='c009'>For several hours the boys continued at the
work, and more than a score of arrows were sent
flying down toward passing vehicles. Meanwhile,
they had become very hungry and thirsty and
some of them visited the pool of water, but it was
stale and brackish and they could not drink it.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the middle of the afternoon all were thoroughly
disheartened, although they continued in
their attempts to attract the attention of passers
on the road below.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally a new element of expectancy was introduced
when Fes called attention to a strange looking
object in the air two miles to the north. He
was very excited when he beheld it, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look! Look! Off there! What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>All looked eagerly. They were in a mood to
hope for help from any improbable source.</p>

<p class='c009'>For several minutes they gazed silently at the
moving object, at first believing it to be a huge
bird. Finally Hal electrified his companions by
announcing wildly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Mr. Miles in his new airship!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c010'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />THE RESCUING AIRSHIP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I bet it is!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think he’s comin’ here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Questions and exclamations such as these came
in rapid succession following the announcement
from Hal that the object flying toward them high
in the air was Johnson Miles’ new airship. It was
approaching rapidly and seemed to be headed
right for the top of Flathead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe he knows we’re here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pickles made the suggestion, and nobody seemed
disposed to take it as a joke. However Hal
replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe he does. How could he, unless
somebody found one of our arrows? We didn’t
see anybody pick any of ’em up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe he’s just hunting for us,” suggested
Fes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s more likely he’s just taking his first
flight,” said Hal. “I’d feel more hopeful if I
knew that was true.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So would I,” said Byron. “He’d probably
fly up here the first place. If he’s hunting for us,
he won’t come here at all unless he knows we’re
here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well he’s surely makin’ for this mountain,”
Hal declared after a few moments of silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>It certainly seemed true. The biplane was flying
at an elevation slightly above that of the
plateau, and did not waver in its course.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got to get busy and make sure that he
sees us,” Hal suddenly exclaimed. “He might
fly right over this mountain without stopping
unless we attract his attention. Take off your
coats and wave ’em and make all the noise you
can when he gets near.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal set the example and the others followed.
Soon the five mountain-top Crusoes were cutting
the wildest capers imaginable and creating a noise
with their throats that surely was loud enough to
be heard within a hundred yards by the aviator
in spite of the vibrations of his propellers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The airship was making remarkable speed and
in less than five minutes from the time it was first
sighted, Johnson Miles glided gently down to a
level spot not far from where the truant Scouts
were capering about. They had forgotten their
hunger, their tired condition, and their despair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a jumble of excited questions as followed
the alighting of the airship could hardly be represented
without a phonographic record. The boys
were eager to know how the aviator discovered
them—did he know they were on the mountain?—and
Mr. Miles was equally curious to learn how
they had come there. Finally he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boys, I’ve brought you some food and water.
You said you were hungry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That settled it. Mr. Miles had read one of the
notes on the whistle-arrows. Naturally, they marveled
at this, but Hal satisfied himself by concluding
that one of the arrows had fallen into one of
the vehicles at which he had directed his aim.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the cabin of the airship, the aviator produced
a large jug of water and a basket filled with
sandwiches and other edibles. Eagerly the boys
poured the cool liquid down their throats and then
pounced upon the contents of the basket. For a
while they did nothing but eat and drink, but at
last Pickles inquired:</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did you know we was here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He found one of the arrows,” laughed Bad.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I didn’t,” replied the aviator.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There! there!” Pickles jeered, pointing his
finger at Frank. “You will know it all, will
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was a little crestfallen, and awaited developments,
hoping for an opportunity to vindicate
himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t find an arrow, but somebody else
did,” explained the rescuer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A-ha! What did I tell you?” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He didn’t find it,” Walter replied stoutly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what’s the difference? I suppose if I
said the top of this mountain’s flat, you’d say it
isn’t ’cause there’s hills on it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My, what silly things you boys quarrel over,”
exclaimed Mr. Miles. “You’re as bad as rival
politicians. If you’ve settled the question I’ll
proceed. The arrow hit Dr. Edwards’ horse as
he was driving through the cañon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I bet that was the horse that ran away,”
interrupted Byron.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it was,” replied Mr. Miles. “He tipped
over the carriage, broke loose and ran back to
town. There he was caught and the arrow found
sticking in his back. The person who found it
took your note to Dr. Byrd.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was Dr. Edwards hurt?” inquired Hal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much. Somebody overtook him just outside
the cañon and gave him a lift, so he didn’t
have to walk all the way home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal’s note tied to the arrow contained brief
information of their predicament and also that
they were hungry and thirsty. It did not, however,
contain any details as to how they had been
trapped over the waterfall cave and later reached
the top of the mountain. Hence, they found it
necessary to relate their experiences as soon as
Mr. Miles had finished his story. Incidentally,
the man discovered that Hal was running away,
but he made no comment on the subject. Neither
did he refer to the nugget episode, which he suspected
to have something to do with the boys’
escapade.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally all the food was eaten, all the water was
gone, and all the stories were told, and then Mr.
Miles suggested that it was time to return to
Lakefarm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How we going to go?” asked Ferdinand.
“In the airship?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure. You boys all wanted a ride in it. Now
you’ll have a chance to prove your nerve.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can’t all ride at once,” objected Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, come now, Bad, don’t back down,” admonished
the aviator mischievously. “You know you
cried out the loudest that you wouldn’t be afraid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I ain’t afraid,” protested Frank angrily, “but
you know there isn’t room enough for all of us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. I agree with, you, Frank. I’ll take only
one with me on the first trip, and that’ll be you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why me? I don’t want to ride alone with you.
You’ll be busy all the time. I want somebody else
to talk with. Let Pickles go the first trip.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right. I don’t care; only I want to try the
ship with one passenger before I take two.
Pickles, you’re not afraid to go first, are you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I ain’t afraid,” replied Walter, smiling.
He seldom became excited or disturbed. Doubtless
he would have watched the moon shoot across
the heavens with no more fear than the average
boy feels over a burning house or a runaway horse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I ain’t afraid either,” insisted Frank, but he
did not offer to make the first trip with Mr. Miles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, you’ll have a chance to prove your
bravery next time,” assured the latter. “Come
on, Pickles, we must hurry, for it’s getting late
and I’ve got to make two more trips before sundown.
It’s after four o’clock now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can make ’em all in half an hour, can’t
you?” inquired Hal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pretty nearly, if everything goes well. But
something might happen to delay me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Walter and the aviator now got aboard the
aeroplane and Mr. Miles started the engine. The
two big propellers turned faster and faster, and
the biplane gave a few jerks and tugs, then leaped
and bounded forward violently over the uneven
ground until the wheels no longer touched the
earth. Rapidly now she arose in the air, circling
around towards the north.</p>

<p class='c009'>In order to insure safety for Walter while giving
his entire attention to the management of the
vessel, Miles had closed the front and rear slides,
so that they were enclosed in a room, or cabin,
twelve feet long, including the tapering forequarter,
and five feet wide. The aviator sat at
the wheel in the narrow prow, while Walter was
free to move about as he wished.</p>

<p class='c009'>The four boys left behind gazed eagerly and
admiringly at the airship with her invisible occupants
for several minutes, not a word escaping
the lips of any of them. Suddenly Frank broke
the silence by saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, fellows, maybe we’ll never have a chance
to come up here again. Dr. Byrd won’t let us
come up in the airship, and the passage through
the cave’s closed. Let’s explore this mountain
top some before Mr. Miles gets back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There isn’t much to explore,” replied Ferd.
“We can see pretty near everything standing
right here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can’t see the other side of those big rocks
and cliffs over there,” Byron answered, pointing
to the south through the thin belt of timber:
“That’s what we were lookin’ at through the
field-glasses from Uncle Sam’s mountain, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, let’s go and have a look at it,” proposed
Hal.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no need of further urging, and the
four boys started off at a brisk rate. Through the
timber they ran and then southward along the
high ridge of rocks and mounds, until they came
to a passage through the rocks. Into this passage
they entered and hastened on until near the middle
a new discovery brought them to a halt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My goodness! Look at that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal exclaimed thus as he stopped suddenly and
pointed toward something very remarkable fifteen
feet ahead. It was the opening of a cave in
the clay and stone wall, and slightly ajar was a
wooden door of rough-hewn tree trunks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, somebody lives up here!” cried Ferdinand
in excited tones. “Let’s go and see who
it is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” Hal cautioned. “We’ve got to be careful.
If anybody does live here, he’s probably
crazy. Let’s pick up some stones to throw at him
if he comes at us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys all accepted this suggestion and soon
they were armed. Then they advanced cautiously
past the opening in the left wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>They reached the western end of the passage
and turned to the right. Here they found a much
more satisfactory view of the rocky and bluff-lined
elevation they had observed through the field-glasses
from the top of Porcupine Hill. In places
the elevation rose two hundred feet above the
level of the plateau. Perhaps at no place was it
more than one hundred feet in thickness, but it
was seven or eight hundred feet long, constituting
by far the biggest mole on the pate of Flathead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Near the pass the line of cliffs presented an
almost perpendicular face to the south, scooped
out here and there in the form of overhanging
shelters. And in these shelters, twenty or thirty
feet from the Flathead level were a number of
openings, cave-like and fronted with ruined outer
structures, that thrilled Hal with a realization of
an important discovery.</p>

<p class='c009'>But this thrill was quickly replaced by another
more intense and immediately important. It was
occasioned by the appearance of a live, cat-like
form, with burning eyes and crouching, hungry
attitude in one of the openings—a panther—and
it was looking right down on the boys.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c010'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />THE PANTHER AND THE CAVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Exclamations of fear escaped the boys as they
saw the threatening attitude of the fierce animal
in the cliff cave. Hal, who had had recent experience
with a similar animal—perhaps the same
one—stood his ground and gazed calmly at the
mountain lion. But Ferdinand and Frank were
quickly panic-stricken and turned and fled into
the passage. Byron hesitated a few moments;
then the fright of Bad and Fes proved too much
for his nerve, and he turned and followed them
as fast as he could run.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be too much to expect even Hal to
stand cool and unmoved under such discouraging
circumstances. The support of even a physically
weak companion would have tended to strengthen
his nerve. As it was, he felt an irresistible power
pulling him backward, and he, too, turned and
raced after the other Boy Scouts.</p>

<p class='c009'>He expected any moment to hear the panther
come hounding after him and to be knocked over
by the springing of the heavy body upon his back.
In despair he wished he had not lost courage and
had stood his ground, but he had no power to turn
and await the approach of the animal. It was too
late now. His only hope—but was there any
hope at all?</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, there was. In the passage was the cave
with the rude timber door. The other boys were
just entering it. Hal reached the entrance just
as Frank was swinging the door to.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fearfully he looked behind, and saw the mountain
lion entering the passage in a half hesitating
manner. Doubtless he had had experience with
human beings that taught him the wisdom of dealing
cautiously with them. Hal stepped inside and
pulled the door to; then, finding that it swung
easily and fitted the entrance fully, he pushed it
open again and stepped outside.</p>

<p class='c009'>The panther had stopped twenty feet away,
crouching to spring, yet hesitating as if afraid.
It was rather dark in the passage and his eyes
blazed like two coals of fire. Hal stood ready to
spring back into the cave and pull the door to if he
should spring.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on in and shut the door,” pleaded Frank
in trembling tones. Byron and Fred seconded the
request, but Hal had good reason for doing otherwise.</p>

<p class='c009'>If he shut himself and his companions in the
cave, it would mean a long imprisonment. He
would be afraid to open the door again lest he
find the panther close to the entrance ready to
spring in. Meanwhile Mr. Miles would return
and would be unable to find them, and then the
mischief would be to pay. Hal must remain outside
and watch for the airship and scream for
help when the aviator landed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I’m going to stay here as long as he don’t
spring at me,” Hal replied. “If it’s too dark in
there and you’re afraid, here’s some matches.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He took several matches from his pocket and
held them behind him. Byron stepped out gingerly
and received them and hastened back into
the cave. Meanwhile, Hal was measuring the distance
between him and the puma and wondering
if he couldn’t do something to make the big cat
retreat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I’d pick up one of these stones and fire it
at him, I wonder what he’d do,” he mused.
“Would he jump at me or would he jump back?
Maybe I ought to just try to scare him and not
hit him. If I hit him, it may make him mad.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I guess I’ll throw one right at him. I
couldn’t hit him if I tried. Nobody could hit a
cat; they’re too quick.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So he picked up a stone half as large as his fist
and threw it with all his force right at the animal.
The latter sprang nimbly aside and the stone
bounded several yards farther on. Encouraged
at the failure of the mountain lion to spring at him,
Hal picked up another stone and hurled it, then
another and another and another. The beast
sprang aside and backward each time, snarling
angrily, but hardly with an accent of courage. Hal
kept up his attack with more and more vigor, and
presently the animal turned and bounded out of
the passage. Just as he disappeared, Hal’s three
companions came rushing toward him in a manner
so startling that the watcher outside chilled
with a fear that the panther’s mate had been discovered
inside.</p>

<p class='c009'>They stopped at the entrance, thus reassuring
Hal somewhat. But this reassurance was dispelled
when he turned and saw their white faces
and scared attitudes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter?” he inquired, for the
moment forgetting the panther.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Hal!” gasped Frank. “There’s a man
back there, and he’s dead!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A man! Dead!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Hal’s turn to gasp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” replied Frank. “We lit some matches
and saw him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a gun back there, too,” continued Fes,
and Hal interrupted him eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that so?” he exclaimed. “Bun, you and
Bad stay here and watch, while Fes and I go and
have a look. If the panther comes back, holler
to me, but don’t shut the door unless he comes too
close.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these instructions, Hal entered the cave,
followed by the trembling Ferdinand. He struck
a match to light his way, and held another to substitute
as soon as the first should burn out. The
hole in the wall was an ordinary cave, eight feet
wide beyond the narrow entrance, six or seven
feet from floor to ceiling, and fifteen feet deep.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the farther end, Hal discovered evidences
that the place had been used as a living room.
There was no table and no chair, but he found a
lantern, a pine box, a gun, some blankets and several
articles of clothing. On the blankets lay the
form of a man. His clothes were torn and his face
was mangled. Evidently he had been attacked by
some wild animal, perhaps the mountain lion. The
man must have been dead for two or three days.</p>

<p class='c009'>Realizing that no more time should be spent in
this place, Hal picked up the rifle which leaned
against the wall, and returned to the entrance.
There he examined the weapon, which was a Winchester.
He pulled down the lever, which opened
the chamber and disclosed five cartridges resting
in the magazine. At the same time an empty
shell flew out, and as he threw back the lever a
fresh cartridge slipped into its place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, fellows,” said Hal, starting for the
entrance. “If the panther comes too close, I’ll
shoot ’im. But I don’t think he’ll bother us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys hastened out of the pass and into the
belt of timber. Before they reached the open,
they discovered the airship resting on the ground
and Mr. Miles looking about him in alarm at the
disappearance of the four Scouts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where have you been?” he inquired as they
came near. Then he added in a tone of astonishment:
“And where did you get that gun?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve had some adventure, believe me,”
replied Hal, as he stopped and rested the butt of
the rifle on a rock. “We’ve seen a panther and
found a dead man in a cave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The aviator was amazed and demanded further
details. The boys told their story in a picturesque
manner, with many gestures and some slang.
The aviator would have been glad to have made a
personal investigation, but it was getting so late
that he decided it best not to delay. So he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got to get a move on us, or we’ll find
ourselves making a trip through the air in the
dark. Come on, now. Who’s going on the next
trip?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank and Ferdinand got aboard, and the ship
again jerked and bounded over the rough ground,
then arose and circled toward the school. Hal and
Byron remained, with the gun for protection in
case the mountain lion should appear again. But
little fear was felt from that source after the
experience they had had with the animal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I bet it’s the same panther we met over on
Porcupine,” declared Byron soon after they were
left alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I bet it is too,” replied Hal.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a short time after they saw the airship glide
down onto the campus, it arose again, and in ten
minutes it alighted on Flathead once more.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Hal and Byron got aboard and experienced
their first thrills as aerial passengers. It
was not nearly so sensational as they had expected,
however. Indeed, it was hardly more thrilling
than going up in an elevator, for they were shut
in on all sides and could look out only through
the windows, and this proved not much different
from gazing out of a window of a sky-scraper in
the city.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />TO FLATHEAD BY AIRSHIP AGAIN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Byrd said little to the boys that evening.
He greeted them quietly, but not severely, as
they arrived, looked them over to see that they
were sound and unhurt by exposure, hustled them
to the bath and later to supper, and then sent them
to bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys wondered a little over this. Naturally,
they all expected to be called on the carpet,
lectured, and then punished. But the doctor’s
tone of voice was almost reassuring. He suspected
that they had been punished enough and
that if a boy won’t think after such an experience,
there isn’t much hope for him. He understood
the motive that had caused Hal to run away, as
well as the sentiments that had moved the other
boys to accompany him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next morning, however, Dr. Byrd called the
five truants into his office. He asked them to be
seated, and then turned to his desk, at which he
busied himself ten or fifteen minutes. At the end
of this period Mr. Miles entered and took a seat
near the doctor, who now wheeled around in his
chair and gave attention to his callers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, boys,” he said slowly, wiping his glasses
with his handkerchief, “what do you think of
yourselves? Are you proud of what you have
done, or do you agree that such an escapade deserves
something of a reckoning?” he added as
he squinted with one eye through one of the lenses
to see if it was clear.</p>

<p class='c009'>Each of the boys waited for one of the others
to answer. As the doctor had addressed none of
them individually, now was a good opportunity
for them to maintain the silence so often urged
upon the young in the presence of older persons.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see you’re not very proud of what you’ve
done,” continued the doctor. “And I’m not particularly
proud of you either, although you conducted
yourselves well after you found yourselves
in a bad fix, I understand. Why did you decide
to run away, Hal?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kenyon hung his head. Then he stole a glance
at the aviator, who reassured him with a kindly
look.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Miles thought I was a thief, and I couldn’t
prove I wasn’t,” Hal answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You found a nugget in the cave, did you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but I didn’t know what it was till I
dropped it in the wash room. I hunted for the
others in the cave night before last, but couldn’t
find any more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Mr. Miles tells me he has decided that
you are honest. He believes your story after being
with you and talking with you on the mountain.
But don’t you think you made a mistake by
running away? Shouldn’t you have remained
here and faced the music?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe I should,” Hal replied dubiously.
“But I don’t see how I could have proved I was
innocent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” concluded the doctor slowly, “I’ve
decided you ought not to be punished; only I want
to give you this advice: Don’t ever run away
from unjust suspicion and don’t do anything that
will make you liable to just suspicion. As to you
other boys, there is no excuse for your running
away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We didn’t mean to run away,” broke in
Pickles. “We were just going a ways with Hal
and then come back before morning. But we got
caught.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that true?” inquired the doctor, addressing
the other boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it is,” came the reply in chorus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well!” exclaimed the owner of Lakefarm.
“It came near being a pretty serious trap, didn’t
it? I’ll take the matter under advisement and
decide later what I’ll do. Meanwhile, there is a
more important matter to be looked after. How
would you boys like to visit the top of Flathead
again?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the airship?” inquired Byron eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the only way to get up there, now that
the passage through the roof of the cave is
closed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>All the boys were overjoyed at the prospect.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are going to visit the cave where you
found the dead body of a man,” continued Dr.
Byrd. “I have notified the coroner and he has
expressed the desire to have you all present when
he takes the body away. It won’t be necessary,
but I’ve decided to let you go if you wish to. I am
going myself. I have full confidence in the safety
of Mr. Miles’ airship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When are we going?” Hal inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As soon as the coroner gets here—half an
hour. Now go and get ready for the trip, if you’ve
decided you want to go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The five Scouts left the doctor’s office and went
to their rooms. They doffed their class-room
clothes and shoes and substituted their coarse,
strong mountain-climbing suits and heavy-nailed
footgear. Then they hastened out onto the campus,
where they found Mr. Miles getting the airship
ready to fly. Most of the other boys of the
school were gathered around the aeroplane, watching
proceedings with interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course the five returned truants were the
objects of much interest and questioning when
they appeared. The other boys all knew in a general
way what had happened to their runaway associates,
and they were now hungry for details.
But the arrival of the coroner and the announcement
that the boy explorers of Flathead were
about to make another trip through the air added
a new excitement and so much confusion that there
was little opportunity for anybody to gain any
information.</p>

<p class='c009'>Coroner Huffman and Pickles made the first
trip with Mr. Miles to the top of the mountain.
This official, who lived in Jimtown, was a great
hunter. He had held one and another political
office for fifteen years and celebrated each election
by going off into the mountains to shoot big
game. On this occasion, he had his rifle with him,
hoping to get a shot at the mountain lion that
Kenyon and his companions had seen the day
before.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the first trip was being made, Hal, Frank,
Byron, and Ferdinand were surrounded by their
eager schoolmates and plied with numerous questions.
Then the doctor, in order to simplify matters,
asked everybody to keep still and suggested
that Hal tell the story from beginning to end.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Kenyon told the story of their adventure
in detail. Before he had finished, the aeroplane
returned and started on another trip, with Byron,
Frank, and Ferdinand as passengers. The aviator
had decided that, since the airship was built
to carry three men including the operator, it ought
to carry one man and three boys at once. The
experiment proved that he was right.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time Mr. Miles returned for the doctor
and Hal, the latter had satisfied the curiosity of
his schoolmates. Some of them begged for permission
to make the trip also, but Dr. Byrd said
that since it would be impossible to take all, he
must limit his permission to those whom the coroner
had asked to be present at the removal of the
body from the mountain-top cave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally, the entire party of eight men and boys
was conveyed to the Flathead plateau. The
landing place chosen this time was a level and
comparatively smooth spot west of the patch of
timber and east of the pool.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal, with the permission of Dr. Byrd, had
brought with him the rifle that had been found in
the cave. He, too, hoped to see the mountain lion
again and get a shot at it. As they approached
the landing place he examined closely the ruins
of the homes of the cliff dwellers, where they had
seen the panther on the day before, but it was
no longer there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wasn’t that a funny place for cliff dwellers
to build their homes?” Hal inquired as they were
descending to the plateau.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it is,” replied the doctor. “I can’t account
for their going up so high, unless there was
unusual need of defense against some of their war-like
neighbors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you suppose they got up here?”
asked the boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The same way you did probably—behind the
waterfall. I imagine they were afraid to trust
that secret passage alone to protect them against
their enemies, so they made their homes high up
in these cliffs as a second precaution.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go up in some of those caves before we
go back,” Hal proposed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am planning to make as thorough an exploration
of this plateau as possible to-day,” the
doctor replied. “But first we must investigate
the death of this man whose body you found.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The other members of the party were awaiting
the arrival of the last airship-load of passengers,
as the coroner desired the presence of all the original
witnesses when he removed the body. After
all had been landed on the top of the mountain, no
further delay was necessary, and they proceeded
directly to the cave in the passage through the
long ridge.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two lanterns had been brought along, and with
the aid of these the coroner made a careful
inspection of the cave. He asked numerous questions
in order to determine if the boys had destroyed
or disarranged any clews that might lead
to a clearing up of the mystery surrounding this
strange life and death on the mountain top.
Meanwhile, not an article of the contents of the
cave was moved until the careful examination was
finished. Mr. Huffman even caused Hal to lean
his gun against the wall as nearly as it had been
found as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he and the doctor picked up the body and
carried it out to the open to give it a thorough
examination. There seemed to be no doubt that
he had been slain by a wild beast. The body was
badly mangled, particularly the upper part and
the head. The clothes about the chest were ripped
in shreds, indicating the savage nature of the
slayer. But the clothing proved to be of good
quality, indicating that their owner had not been
a tramp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I bet he was a robber hiding from the police,”
Hal declared as the coroner began to search the
dead man’s pockets.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next instant the official drew forth several
envelopes and pieces of paper and began to
examine them. Suddenly Dr. Byrd, who was watching
this inspection closely, leaned forward and
snatched an envelope from the coroner’s hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great heavens!” he exclaimed. “This is
Maxwell, the instructor who stole my most valuable
gems.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />CLEARING HAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>With nervous haste, Dr. Byrd took a piece of
folded paper from the envelope and examined it.
The letter was short and had to do with a purchase
from a mail order house. It was addressed
to Rodney Maxwell, Boulder, Colorado, care of
the Miners &amp; Merchants’ Bank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So that’s where he was,” the doctor muttered,
half to himself. “The last I heard of him
he was in Denver.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Coroner Huffman, meanwhile, was examining
the other envelopes. Suddenly, he looked up at
the doctor and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I can give you some interesting information.
This Miners &amp; Merchants’ Bank was
robbed two or three months ago and the police
are looking for this fellow Maxwell. He was a
teller there, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t say!” exclaimed the owner of
Lakefarm. “It’s singular that I didn’t see it in
the papers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The story was printed all right. You probably
read only the headlines and missed his name.
You don’t read the newspapers the way we politicians
do. Maxwell got away with thirty thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I bet the money’s in the cave,” Hal ventured
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a natural suspicion, and they hastened
the search through the pockets of the dead man’s
clothing. But nothing more was discovered and
the party returned into the cave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s take everything outside and continue
our examination in the sunlight,” the doctor proposed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good suggestion,” said the coroner, picking
up the box and starting for the entrance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Byrd rolled up several blankets, tucked
them under his arm and followed Mr. Huffman.
The lifting of one of the blankets disclosed several
cooking utensils, a bag of salt and half a dozen
empty fruit cans. All these and other articles the
boys picked up and carried outside beyond the
western end of the passage and placed them on
the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>First, the contents of the box were examined,
and they proved to be of great interest. On top
were two books, then several newspapers and
magazines. Next appeared several boxes of
matches, two or three hundred cartridges, also in
boxes, some collars, neckties and handkerchiefs;
two shirts, and finally a small satchel, packed full
and heavy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eagerly the coroner seized the latter and attempted
to open it. But the clasp resisted his
efforts. It was locked.</p>

<p class='c009'>Remembering a bunch of keys he had found in
one of Maxwell’s pockets, the coroner produced it
and tried several in the lock. The fourth fitted
and turned easily, and the satchel fell open.</p>

<p class='c009'>Exclamations of eagerness and satisfaction
burst from the lips of the onlookers. The object
of their search was found. The little valise was
full of paper money, assorted in denominations
and done up in small packages with strips of
paper pinned around them.</p>

<p class='c009'>On each binding strip was written with pencil
some figures representing the amount contained
in the package. These made the counting of the
money easy. In the bottom of the satchel was
more than a thousand dollars in gold coins, the
counting of which required more time than the
totaling of all the assorted certificates and notes.
The coroner made an itemized list of these packages
and coins according to denominations and
amounts. On footing them, he found that the
total was $30,380.</p>

<p class='c009'>The official now drew up a certificate of their
discovery at the foot of the itemized list, and, at
his request, they all signed it. Then he packed
the money back in the valise, with the statement
and certificate on top, and snapped the latch and
locked it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, that’s all done,” Mr. Huffman announced.
“What else have we here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Boys and men now began to overhaul the other
personal effects of the slain robber. They shook
out the blankets, inspected the empty fruit cans,
looked into the cooking utensils and pushed their
hands or fingers into the pockets of the two extra
suits of clothing. In one of these pockets, Dr.
Byrd found a small metal box about twice the
thickness of an ordinary pocket match-safe.</p>

<p class='c009'>With more curiosity than eagerness, he attempted
to open the box, but it resisted his efforts.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Huffman, observing what he had found, held
out his hand saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me try it. I’ve had a good deal of experience
breaking secrets.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Byrd gave him the box, and the coroner
turned it over several times in an effort to find a
clasp or catch. Presently he discovered a tiny
button at one end and pressed on it with his thumb
nail, but with no result. After considerable
manipulation he finally solved the secret by pressing
both sides with thumb and fingers of one hand
while he “picked” the button with the other
thumb nail.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now was the time for a few more gasps of surprise.
And they came. Dr. Byrd’s right hand
shot forward like a “Jack-in-the-box” let loose,
to seize the object of interest. The coroner, however,
held on with both hands to prevent the eager
doctor from spilling the sparkling contents.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Those are mine!” exclaimed the Lakefarm
owner. “Those are the rubies and diamonds
Maxwell stole from my collection over two years
ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whew!” exploded Mr. Huffman. “This
sure is a day of discoveries.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a week of discoveries, it’s a month of discoveries,
it’s a whole summer of discoveries for
Lakefarm and Mummy Cañon,” declared Dr.
Byrd with excusable excitement. “I tell you, this
has been a history making season for Colorado
and even the United States. Think of what has
happened here this summer! Why it’s simply
stupendous. When this cañon becomes a popular
summer resort it will have a most interesting history
for advertising purposes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, you’re right,” agreed Mr. Huffman.
“And these runaway boys have done about all
of it, haven’t they?” he added with a mischievous
look at the five young Scouts standing around and
eagerly listening to the conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I don’t know but you’re right,” admitted
the doctor slowly. “Kenyon discovered
the cave behind the waterfall, and all of them took
a part in the discoveries that followed. In fact,
I think every one of their names should be given
to some point or feature of interest on this mountain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s call the cave behind the waterfall Kenyon
Cave,” proposed Byron.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a bright idea,” declared the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It sounds well. What shall we call the waterfall
itself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Screaming Cataract,” Frank proposed
with a little reminiscent shudder and a grin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good again!” Dr. Byrd exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And that cliff where we stood when we shot
the arrows into the cañon—let’s call that Whistling
Arrow Point,” suggested Ferdinand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep it up, boys, and you’ll soon have everything
well named,” said the coroner with appreciative
cheeriness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then all were startled by an interruption
from Mr. Miles who had been busy while the
others were exclaiming over the discovery of the
money and the gems. In one hand he held a coat
and in the other several objects the size of small
potatoes which he had drawn from one of the
pockets. The objects were of a soiled yellow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve found my nuggets! I’ve found my nuggets!”
cried the aviator gleefully. “Hal, you’re
fully exonerated now, and the mystery of the bag
of specimens in the cave is solved. Maxwell found
them in the cañon, took them behind the waterfall,
picked out the nuggets, left the bag in the cave
and accidentally dropped one of the lumps of
gold!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the excitement of this discovery was
over, another thriller was added to the rapid succession
of events. Suddenly from the very cave
in which they had seen the mountain lion on the
day before, issued a dark object, which bounded
down an incline of stones and earth and sped with
swift leaps past the aeroplane and off toward the

  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />THE BOY SCOUTS OF THE AIR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Coroner Huffman was quickest to act. His
rifle was leaning against a rock near by, and he
snatched it up and took two shots at the flying animal
before it disappeared. Apparently the
panther was not hit.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Mr. Miles was scarcely less active. Like a
sprinter, he started for his airship, twenty yards
away, calling out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, a couple of you. We’ll chase him.
Bring the guns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a general race toward the aeroplane.
The aviator leaped aboard and busied himself
rapidly with the motor. As the rest lined up before
the machine, Dr. Byrd said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Coroner, you and Hal get aboard. You have
guns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This being a logical suggestion, it was adopted
by the two mentioned. They climbed into the
cabin, the wicket was closed, and almost instantly
came the chug-chug of the engine and the great
fan propellers began to revolve. A deep quiver, a
few spasmodic jerks, and the airship started forward,
bumped over the uneven ground, and rose
into the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>The front and rear of the cabin were open except
for the aluminum-bar inclosures, and Hal
looked back and waved his hand at the doctor and
the other boys, who were executing various capers
and cheering lustily. The next instant almost, the
airship passed beyond the edge of the plateau,
and pilot and passengers directed their vision to
a search for the mountain lion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Miles called their attention to a port in the
floor of the cabin and advised them to make use
of that, as well as of the ports in the sides and
the open front and rear. Mr. Huffman slid back
a cover of the floor opening, two feet in diameter
and protected with aluminum bars. Then they
began an inspection of the mountain side as the
ship circled around and around as close to the tree
tops as was deemed safe.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were not long in finding the fleeing animal.
He was leaping with long easy bounds, down the
steep and craggy slope—too steep and irregular
for a man to climb or descend. The aviator
steered the air craft right over him, and the coroner
drew a bead on the cat through the floor port.
With the discharge of the gun, Hal looked eagerly
at the beast, expecting to see him tumble over, but
he was disappointed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Blast the luck!” muttered the coroner, who
was ordinarily a good shot. “I don’t believe I
can hit him from the moving airship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me try it,” Hal shouted above the noise
of the propellers, having read the meaning of the
expression on the face of his companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The latter moved aside and the boy thrust the
muzzle of his gun through the opening. Taking
careful aim, he pulled the trigger, but with no better
success. Even as the gun was discharged, he
felt the difficulty of their hunt. To shoot a rapidly
moving animal from a rapidly moving airship
is no easy task.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal’s shot, however, seemed to be the signal for
an altering of the course of the fleeing panther.
The latter evidently saw the source of his danger,
and turned suddenly to the left and bounded over
crags and through patches of fir and spruce to the
southern side of the mountain. The pursuers flew
after him, firing at the moving target every now
and then. Finally the beast landed on the ledge
of the “mummy” from which the cañon took its
name. There he halted a moment, looking upward
at his flying enemy. Another shot from Hal’s rifle
caused him to leap so suddenly that the boy believed
he had hit him; but if so, the animal was
not seriously injured. He bounded on, down the
very course by which the boys had ascended the
mountain. Finally he stopped and gazed in a
puzzled manner at the boulder that blocked his
entrance through the roof of Kenyon Cave behind
the Screaming Cataract, as recently named.</p>

<p class='c009'>He stuck his head through the fissure beside the
bowlder and seemed about to leap when Coroner
Huffman fired again. Possibly he was hit; at any
rate, he drew his head back and bounded along
the steep side of the mountain to the left. Several
rods he sprang in this direction; then down,
down he went with wonderful swiftness and
agility, until he reached the new railing-bordered
walk between Flathead and the river. This
seemed to puzzle him a little, but he hesitated only
a moment. Then the occupants of the airship
were astonished to see the animal bound along the
walk, over the waterfall bridge and behind the
cataract.</p>

<p class='c009'>Quickly the coroner stepped close to the aviator
and shouted:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fly back to the top of the mountain. We’ve
got to have some lanterns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miles caught the significance of the suggestion
and in a very short time the airship had circled
upward and over Flathead and alighted near the
other boys and Dr. Byrd.</p>

<p class='c009'>The purpose of their return was quickly explained,
the lanterns were taken aboard, and away
they flew again. In a few minutes they landed
near the head of the rapids in Mummy Cañon and
then proceeded to cross the first bridge and advance
up the walk, with lighted lanterns, toward
the Screaming Cataract.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Miles was stationed outside with Hal’s gun,
to shoot the animal if he should spring past the
other two, who crossed the second bridge into the
cave. Each of the latter carried a lantern and
they advanced carefully, flashing their lights as
far ahead as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Around the elbow of the cave they proceeded
without catching sight of their quarry. Even in
the farther chamber they were somewhat puzzled
until by flashing their lights over the sloping wall,
they perceived two shining eyes high up near the
bowlder that choked the upper exit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Huffman set his lantern down and put the
stock of his gun to his shoulder. But even as he
sighted along the barrel, the gleaming eyes had
disappeared.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look out!” yelled Hal. A horrible screech
came from the blank darkness. Huffman raised
his rifle and fired in the direction of the sound.
The thundering report of the gun almost deafened
them, but shrill above even that came a second
scream. The next instant Hal felt a big body
catch him between the legs. Down he went, his
lantern flying from his hand and shattering
against the rocky wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he rose to his feet it was to see Mr. Huffman,
lantern in hand, careering over the rock-strewn
floor toward the mouth of the cave. “Look
out there, Miles!” he yelled as he ran.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal scrambled his way out as well as he could in
the dark, expecting every second to hear the report
of Mr. Miles’ rifle. Instead he heard a
shout and then a cry of pain. As he came to the
cave entrance he saw the cause.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Miles had been taken unawares. The lion
had come hurtling at him at too close range for
him to use the rifle. Blinded perhaps by the sudden
glare of daylight, the animal had charged full
at him, and down Miles had gone. There he lay
at the very edge of the bridge, clutching at the railing
with one hand, and holding the other over his
stomach.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wouldn’t mind, if he’d hit me anywhere
else,” he gasped, in mingled pain and laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s your gun?” asked Mr. Huffman
suddenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s the lion?” Miles asked in return.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think he swallowed it?” asked Hal
with a chuckle. At that they all gave way, as both
Hal and the coroner had been aching to do, so comical
was Mr. Miles’ pain-drawn face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid it must have been knocked over
the falls,” Mr. Miles managed at last to suggest.
“He hit me pretty hard, and my game leg isn’t
any too strong—especially when the pesky animal
tried football on me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gun was undoubtedly gone, and it must
have fallen into the water.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll have to come back and dive for it,”
added Hal with a sigh, for in a way he looked upon
the rifle as his own. “That’ll be fun for us
Scouts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hate to have that lion get away,” said the
coroner regretfully; “but I suppose we might as
well go back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suppose I take you two to Lakefarm and then
go back from there for the rest,” said Miles as
they walked back toward the aeroplane. “It will
save time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So it was decided, and the two were soon
dropped at Lakefarm, where they were awaited
by an eager crowd of boys. Then Mr. Miles
whirred back toward the top of Flathead, soon
to return with his first load. On the last trip he
brought back the body of the dead Maxwell and
Dr. Byrd.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, boys, we’ve had a pretty strenuous day—or
days. I think that the Boy Scouts of the Air
deserve a little holiday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Boy Scouts <em>of the Air</em>?” asked one of
the waiting group.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, the Boy Scouts of the Air, of Flathead
Mountain, with a membership of five.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” came a disappointed murmur from the
rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I think we’ll make the holiday general,
and maybe the Air Patrol can enroll some new
members. So to-morrow we’ll just scatter and enjoy
ourselves our own way.” The shout that
went up left no doubt that the decision was popular.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Three cheers for the Boy Scouts of the Air!”
came from a score of throats as the doctor turned
to go in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rah for Doctor Byrd!” came from the five
Boy Scouts of the Air in return.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />MOUNTAIN LION BRIDGE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“How you going to spend your holiday?”
asked Bad of Hal the next morning when the two
chanced to meet on the campus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sh! Not so loud,” was the reply. “I’m going
to explore Kenyon Cave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the doctor—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He said we could do as we pleased to-day.
I’m going to see if I can’t get that gun again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And hunt the lion? But it’s under the falls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think it is. That lion hit Mr. Miles
hard enough to knock him down. That gun must
have gone a-flying. Maybe it dropped in shallow
water. And the biggest part of the falls is on the
other side anyway. I’ll chance it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we could take some grapple hooks—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We?” asked Hal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure. I’m going along. Suppose that lion’d
show up—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, suppose. What’d you do? Save my life
by running away and getting the cat to follow
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind. You ran from it yourself the
other day. You just watch me when we find it
again. I’ll—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Clout it in the jaw?” laughed Hal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know where there’s grapple hooks,” Bad
suggested. “I’ll get them.” And away he went,
to return in a few minutes with a tangled mass of
cords and hooks stuffed under his coat. “Ready
to go now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Soon as I get a lantern. I hid one inside the
hollow elm next to the road. Come on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So the two started out on their three-mile
trudge, stopping to pick up the lantern and a
lunch that was likewise hidden within the tree.
“Divvies,” said Hal generously as he shoved this
into his pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not long before Mummy Cañon was in
sight. They crossed the bridge and made their
way slowly along the path toward the Screaming
Cataract. Just before they came to the bridge
they stopped. Bad sat down and began to pull off
his shoes and stockings, but Hal merely stood
looking at the water, that was boiling and foaming
even along the shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It can’t be very deep in there this side the
falls,” he observed. “The gun could easy have
fallen right in next to shore. Of course it could
have gone the other way, but that ain’t likely, as
the lion hit Miles in this direction. If it did go
toward the middle we’ll never get it—unless we
happen to grapple it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What you going to do? Try to grapple it
first or dive?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or wade if it isn’t too deep. But first of all
I’m going to take a look inside the cave. I want to
see if that rock is wedged in hard like it looked
from above.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What for? Suppose the lion’s in there!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hal laughed. “He got too good a scare in there
yesterday to come back right away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why not find the gun first? What good’ll
it do you if the rock isn’t tight. Come on, I’m going
in.” And Bad continued taking off his
clothes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I’ll cool off first. You go ahead. I’ll go
up on the bridge and show you where the gun most
likely fell.” He gathered a handful of small
stones and standing on the bridge, began to throw
them into the water, marking off a small circle that
extended from the edge of the falls to the shore.
“It ought to be inside that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right. Here goes,” called Bad as he began
wading away from the bank. “U-u-gh! it’s
cold. So deep,” he added, ducking himself under
to the chin, pretending he had found a step-off—to
come up to his waist a minute later.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Call me if you find it,” Hal said, after lighting
his lantern with a match, Boy Scout style being
too slow just then. “I’ll be with you in a few
minutes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He disappeared within the cave, and Bad continued
wading out toward the edge of the fall,
feeling for the gun with his toes. This was an
easy matter, as the bottom was a firm sort of sand-mud,
smooth and gently sloping. The water deepened
till it was up to his neck, but that was all.
Out under the falls it was doubtless many times
deeper, but here the thin trickle from above had
not worn any hole.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess I’ll cut in toward the bridge,” he said
to himself, “and then work over along the bank.”
As he came under the bridge he stood there a
moment, holding to one of the timbers, for at this
point the undertow from the falls was rather
strong.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he stood there his mischievous spirit
prompted him to play a trick on Hal. Wouldn’t it
be a lark to climb up under the bridge and stretch
himself out along the timbers and wait there for
Hal? What would he think when he came out and
found no Bad in the water? He had laughed at
Bad’s scare when the plank tipped, that night
when Kenyon Cave was discovered. Here was a
good chance to get even.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Bad wormed himself up one of the posts, and
after a good deal of squirming found himself a
firm and fairly comfortable resting place where
two bracing timbers formed a V-shaped bed.
Right above him was a large knothole, within a
few inches of his eyes. He lay there and waited
some time, his only view the tumbling water just
beneath, and above, a knothole sight of the cliff
and a patch of blue sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once he was tempted to call, but waited. Then,
above him, on the boards of the bridge, he heard a
quiet footfall. It sounded like bare feet; perhaps
that was why Hal had been so long—he had
stopped to undress. The footfalls ceased. Bad
fancied he heard a curious sniffing noise, that kept
up till it got on his nerves. What could Hal be
doing that would make such a funny noise! Bad
tried to look through the knothole. Only blue sky
and gray cliff could be seen. But still that sniff-sniff
kept up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Putting his mouth to the knothole, he drew in
his breath and then “Wow!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the answer was not what he expected. A
low snarl came in reply, and the snarl was too
animal-like to have come from Hal. Bad almost
fell from his perch in his sudden fright. Again he
put his eye to the hole, but jerked back with a
scream. A cold, damp something had touched his
face, and that something he knew instinctively
was the muzzle of an animal.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps it was this thought that made him lose
his balance. At any rate, almost before he realized
it, he had toppled out of his seat and into the
water. For an instant he floundered, then struck
out, under water, to get as far away as he could.
He did not stop to reason that the animal, whatever
it was, would hardly attack him in the water;
he merely wanted to get away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then suddenly he stopped and came to his feet.
His hand had struck something solid. It felt not
unlike the branch of a tree or a stick—or a rifle
barrel. It was standing straight up in the water.
For a second he groped about, then struck it
again. With a feeling of triumph he grasped it
and gave a tug that freed it from the mud. It
was the rifle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he looked toward the bridge. There, its
teeth bared in a snarl, was the mountain lion of
the day before. It was not crouched, but stood
there, its head going from side to side in an impatient
shake, its tail beating the bridge floor angrily.
But for an instant only it remained so.</p>

<p class='c009'>With an alert turn of the head it directed its attention
to the cave. It had heard something. Bad
heard the same sound; it was Hal coming out, and
Bad stood as if paralyzed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stay in the cave!” he yelled, suddenly regaining
command of his voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m coming,” came the indistinct reply.
“Did you find the gun?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stay in the cave! The lion’s on the bridge!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t understand you.” Bad had difficulty
in hearing the words, broken by the irregularity of
the passage and drowned by the noise of the falls.
“I’m coming fast as I can—my lantern’s out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh-h—” groaned Bad, “what shall I do?
Don’t come out!” he shrieked again. There was
no reply. The lion had not stirred, crouching expectantly
at the opening. When Hal appeared, it
would spring—and Bad shuddered at the
thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the gun! Suddenly he remembered that.
He looked at the breech; it was unrusted. He
threw a shell into place; then he thought of the
barrel. One glance told him it was choked with
mud.</p>

<p class='c009'>What could he do? He remembered hearing of
a gun that had burst because there was mud in
the end of the barrel. True, that was a shotgun.
Dared he risk it? He brought the gun to his
shoulder—then hesitated.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bad was no coward, but he knew the risk.
“Hal!” he yelled for the last time. There was
no reply, but the click of footsteps and a loud
“Ouch!” told him his call had done no good.
He saw the lion crouch still lower, the leg muscles
tightened, and then—Bang!</p>

<p class='c009'>Bad had shut his eyes as he pulled the trigger.
Furthermore, he had not held the rifle very tight
to his shoulder; he picked himself out of the water
and gave a frightened look toward the bridge.
The lion was still there but no longer crouching.
He was whirling round and round, a struggling
bundle of rage and scratching claws. His savage
whines sent the cold chills up and down Bad’s
back. Coming too close to the edge of the bridge,
the lion rolled off—and Bad hastily scrambled
his way toward the bank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello!” called Hal, appearing just then in
the cave entrance. “What’s up, Bad?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing,” said Bad limply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing? Is that what makes you look so
sick? What you been doing with the gun?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing.” Then he added slyly but shakily:
“I just clouted Mr. Lion in the jaw.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The lion! Was it you that shot? Where is
he?” came in rapid succession.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe he went downstairs there to get a
drink,” laughed Bad, his voice and legs getting
stronger. “If you’ll help me to fish him out, we’ll
lug him back to Lakefarm, and s’prise the natives.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And that was certainly what they did, as, a
couple of hours later, they arrived, fagged out but
proud, at Lakefarm Institute and dropped their
trophy at the feet of Mr. Byrd, who, with Mr.
Frankland and Mr. Miles and Mr. Porter, as well
as all the Boy Scouts, was waiting to receive them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And who shot him?” asked Dr. Byrd, after
the slain beast had been inspected and admired to
the full expectations of the two heroes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was Frank,” Hal replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not <em>Bad</em>?” asked Dr. Byrd, quite seriously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No—Frank. Bad has made <em>good</em>, and he’s
been promoted. From now on he’s Frank.”</p>
